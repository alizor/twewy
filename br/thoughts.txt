Yukata
--------------------
Girls in yukata robes are really hot, yup yup...
But guys look pretty slick in 'em, too.

That's it...
I'm spending my whole summer in one!
--------------------
Organizer
--------------------
Stupid me!
I gotta make tonight's party a smash,
but I forgot my secret weapon:
nose glasses!

Arg... Pulling this off will be a trial.
--------------------
Rival
--------------------
The real star of "Slammurai" has got to be
the rival character, the Black Slammurai.

Some things never change.
People are more drawn to the dark and
mysterious guy than the straight shooter.
--------------------
Costume
--------------------
I need something really out there to
draw people to the event at my shop...
Too bad I don't have one of those big
mascot uniforms.

Like...maybe a cute black kitty!
--------------------
Wizard
--------------------
I wonder if this "Wizard of Slam"
character is for real...
How can anybody be that good at Tin Pin?

I'll have to keep an eye out for the
signature red glasses.
--------------------
Small face
--------------------
I wish I had a smaller face.
Wait, what if I wrapped it every day
before I got in the tub?
I bet that'd shrink it down!
Ah, I'm a genius!
--------------------
Triple threat
--------------------
The Iwata brothers are freaks,
all three of them.

Of course, their folks are pretty weird too...
Guess it's genetic.
--------------------
Home cooking
--------------------
My girl is a domestic goddess.
But why's all her food gotta taste like
mayonnaise? At least use some ketchup
for a change of pace...
--------------------
Maid
--------------------
Some maid in pink just passed by here...
Wonder what café she works at.
Hmm, but she was headed for the upscale
neighborhood...

Wait...are there REAL maids!?
--------------------
Gift
--------------------
I've been so busy, I never got around to
opening that New Year's gift I got last year...
Wonder what's inside.
Hope it wasn't something perishable...

Urg, now I'm scared to open it.
--------------------
Healing
--------------------
Been so stressed lately,
I really need some comfort...
but I'm sick of people.

I know<->I'll fill my room with potted plants!
Wonder where they sell the best ones...
--------------------
Christmas!
--------------------
This Christmas'll be the first one
with my girlfriend!
I need to get her to slip into a Mrs. Claus
outfit...and maybe let me sit on her lap
and tell her what I want... Oh, hell yeah!
This calls for research!
--------------------
Cheap
--------------------
Heh heh heh... This outfit is perfect.
Verily, I am a fashion genius!
No one will ever notice the whole thing
only set me back 3,000 yen.
--------------------
Comics
--------------------
Bored... Maybe I'll hit the manga café.
But, if I go to Kikuchi's house instead,
I can read for free!

Oh, he's still at work. Hmm...
I'll just have to jump him afterwards then!
--------------------
Let down
--------------------
Aw, man...
That guy from class doesn't know CAT.
What a liar. Who am I supposed to trust?

Oh, well. I'll just have to become a famous artist
so I can rub noses with CAT myself.
--------------------
Donations
--------------------
If everyone here donated just
100 yen each, think of all the good things
we could do for the world...
--------------------
Careless
--------------------
Guess Gramps will be late since he has to
go back to the store...

Seriously, how do you forget your teeth?
--------------------
Stuck here
--------------------
What...the...hell?
Where'd they go?

I'm too scared to get on a motorcycle
without my lucky biker gloves!
--------------------
Wrestling
--------------------
Oh, crap! Did I leave it at home?
But I'm Supermask!
I can't be a masked wrestler without the mask!
What about my match today?

I know<->I'll run out and get a knockoff!
--------------------
Ninja
--------------------
Shibuya's so crowded.
I wish I could throw on some ninja garb
and just leap from rooftop to rooftop.

Aw, but I already wore mine on
Tuesday...
--------------------
Bar code
--------------------
I'm doomed... Baldness is in my genes!
I need a solution...but those "bar code"
comb-overs look lame.

I know! I'll wear a samurai helm around!
No one will pay attention to my hairline then!
--------------------
Not fair
--------------------
Hmm, lunch, lunch...
Oh, what about that beefbowl fair that
just started? I could splurge and order
extra rice and an egg...

Nah, gotta think healthy... Salad again.
--------------------
Happiness
--------------------
Ahh, I finally found a good job.
I could do it forever!
Reaper Creeper's answers are dead-on
every time.

Heh, "dead" on. I should jot that down.
--------------------
Armor
--------------------
Bah, that "expert" had no clue what
he was talking about. I know a suit of
samurai armor when I see it.
Well made, too<->I bet you could take a
lot of punishment with that on.
--------------------
War of flyers
--------------------
Those record store guys decided to settle
their stupid rivalry, but not with a truce<->
ohh, no, they're gonna hit the stage, get a
whole bunch of guests and TALK it out.

Where do I get tickets?
--------------------
Growth spurt
--------------------
I heard inch-high Issun's magic mallet
is hidden somewhere in Shibuya...

Sure, it's probably a myth, but if I had that...
Man! I could wish myself tall and get all the
chicks!
--------------------
I got air!
--------------------
So, I tried doing some ollies like Kyo.
Except I messed up, and messed MYSELF up
pretty bad. But it was a worthy sacrifice!

Besides, I only need one to have kids.
--------------------
Pet food
--------------------
I haven't fed the goldfish in a while...
or myself, for the past three days.
Damn, I am so broke.
But goldfish could make a very tasty m<->
No, no, arrrgh!
--------------------
Revelation
--------------------
That feller sure does take his time walkin'.
What a hick, hyuck hyuck...
You gotta walk fast here in Shibberya!
Ahh! Golly, I think I just figgered it out!
People only pegged me as a rustic 'cause
I walked too durn slow!
--------------------
Real deal
--------------------
I never put much stock in urban legends,
but I guess some really are true.
I asked her out from that phone by Molco,
and sure enough, I got me a date!
--------------------
Date
--------------------
Today's my date with Dr. Fumiko!
She's a real foodie, so I've got to take her
to a top-class restaurant.

Urg, this is gonna break the bank...
--------------------
Changes
--------------------
I bagged the wrong guy the other day...
Three weeks on this stakeout, and now
I realize:
Shibuya's look changes so quick, the suspect
won't look anything like my photo now.
Dammit...
--------------------
Samaritan
--------------------
What are the odds? I helped that girl
find her grandfather's place, and it turned
out to be the herbal medicine shop!
Now I can finally shop there.
Guess the old guy was just screening his
customers because he cares...
--------------------
Any fans?
--------------------
Man, I am so butt-ugly!
I wish I had a folding fan or something
to hide behind...

This is Japan, how hard could it be
to find one?
--------------------
Auction
--------------------
That adorable uniform I saw at the
Shibuya Game Show is up for auction!

I knew I could get one if I looked
hard enough! I am so going to bid on it.
--------------------
Other worlds
--------------------
First I started seeing things.
Then those voices in my head...
I thought I was going nuts.
But maybe...
Maybe there's more to life than
what the eyes can see.
--------------------
777...
--------------------
No way, I must be imagining things...
I was stalk<->er, following 777,
but the moment I took my eyes off him,
he vanished!

I swear, there was no place for him to hide...
--------------------
Celebrating
--------------------
This is the hundredth time I got snapped
for a fashion mag. Go me!
I bought all thirty copies I could find to
pass out to my friends!
--------------------
Destiny
--------------------
I can't believe that gentleman who helped
me knew Grandfather!

If Grandfather likes him, he must truly be
a wonderful man. Could this be fate?
--------------------
Stupid!
--------------------
Today's the first day of the Prince's
concert tour, and I forgot to order tickets!

<->SNAP<->

Ahh, there goes my grip on reality.
--------------------
I'm onto you
--------------------
Hey! You there!
Peeping at my thoughts, huh?
I know you are!
Well, if you think you can mind-control me
or something, you're sorely mistaken!
--------------------
100% CAT
--------------------
If I go with a cell phone designed by CAT,
there's no point in me sticking decorations
on it...

But if CAT designed it pre-decorated?
Perfect!
--------------------
Just like that
--------------------
Huh? Where the heck am I?

No waaay! How am I supposed to
find my way around if even the
landmark stores keep changing?
--------------------
Mentality
--------------------
Whew, I'm beat. I want to go home<->
but nah, my room's a mess.

Better I hit a manga café and READ about
cleaning than waste a real mop!
--------------------
Dreams
--------------------
If I go to the beauty salon now,
I'll fall asleep for sure.

But then again...at least in my dreams
that hunky stylist actually talks to me!
Win!
--------------------
New post!
--------------------
Ooh, the Prince posted on his blog!
Let's see...
"Today I had ramen for lunch."
Huh? Ramen again?
That can't possibly be healthy...
--------------------
Royal growth
--------------------
The Prince wrote in his blog that he quit
voice lessons.
Guess he's gained more confidence...
or come to grips with his suckiness.
--------------------
My salt!
--------------------
Hmm, I could use a snack.
Good thing I picked up those fries.

...Oh, no! I left my can of salt at home!
Good thing I have some miso paste
on me. Better than nothing!
--------------------
Missionary
--------------------
I missed my 100-person goal,
but I got close!

I'll satisfy myself with that for now.
--------------------
Reason
--------------------
They say the guy who runs the café
on Cat Street vanishes now and then...

Vanishes? Sounds like laziness to me.
--------------------
Diva
--------------------
Ugh, my throat is trashed.
It's gotta be the karaoke overload.

Why do I sing so much when I'm not even
a singer? Think, girl, think!
--------------------
I'm getting...
--------------------
Goosebumps again!
This bad energy is creeping me out!
It's been like this day after day...

I had no idea we were so close to the
hellmouth.
--------------------
Bad girl
--------------------
My honeybear said,
"Don't get any thinner," so, like,
both of us got fat.

But that's OK.
Now there's more of us to love!
--------------------
Scouted...
--------------------
Once you're scouted by an agency,
you have to pay them, like, all the time...
But...they're teaching me a lot, right?
I gotta stick with this!
--------------------
Thankful
--------------------
They say that going over the things
you're thankful for while mopping the floor
brings good luck. OK, look out, world!
Soon as I get home, I'm scrubbing the place
from top to bottom!
--------------------
Deadline
--------------------
The deadline for my manga's come and gone,
but no one's tried to contact me at all...
I wasn't...fired, was I?

Nah, that's impossible, right?
--------------------
Box set
--------------------
Incredible...
The game sold over a million copies in
just one week.
Now that's what I call momentum.
--------------------
Oh yeah!
--------------------
Now I remember! Crap...
I have to return those CDs I rented!

What's the point of a half-price sale if
I pay three times as much in late fees!?
--------------------
Too much?
--------------------
I thought my new perfume
turned out perfect, but people are
giving me a wide berth...

Geez, is it that powerful?
--------------------
Smells...good?
--------------------
What is up with that scent?
Appealing, but DANGEROUS. Like...
"Get any closer and you will get burned."
It's very...interesting?
--------------------
Hat
--------------------
I've been searching like crazy, but I can't
find a hat I like.

Maybe the problem's not the hat.

Maybe it's my head...
--------------------
Weird...
--------------------
What happened?
I was crazy about the guy when it was
just a crush, but as soon as we
started going out...nothing.
--------------------
Bracelet
--------------------
Oh! My misanga broke.
My wish had better come true now.
Three years...
I should've wished the damn thing would
break sooner.
--------------------
Singles party
--------------------
Oh no, someone cancelled last minute!
Now what? I need an even head count... 
Maybe Mika?
She's got a man...but hey, you can never
have enough of those, right?
--------------------
Misled
--------------------
Turns out CAT isn't twenty people,
and definitely not twenty folks with the
same face.

Guess I should've figured as much.
Durff!
--------------------
Whoever
--------------------
Was today's date with Tokio?
Or Atsushi?
--------------------
True calling
--------------------
Watching Yumi's stage show
convinced me she'd make a better
comedian than actress.

Hrm...
Wonder if I should tell her that.
--------------------
Crisis?
--------------------
I can't believe the Shibu-Q trio broke up!
Everybody but Iwata quit!
You can't have a band with just vocals...

It's probably his fault, though, for hogging
the spotlight...
--------------------
Fine with me
--------------------
So what if CAT's really a cat?
Cats are cute. I like cats.
We could have a beautiful life together.
Why let a little fur stop me from marrying
the man of my dreams?
--------------------
Gentrified
--------------------
Since Pegaso opened their branch here,
Shibuya's been drawing a wealthier crowd.
Fashion at its pinnacle can shape a
city, even define an era.
--------------------
Coming out
--------------------
I'm taking my girl to a party and I want 
her to wear something pretty. If I buy 
everything Pegaso has in stock, there 
should be something she'd like, right?
--------------------
Watches
--------------------
Pegaso watches are excellent!
Anything else is just trash.
--------------------
Dilemma
--------------------
I want to wear Pegaso to this party, but
then the wait staff won't approach me for
fear of spilling something on my clothes!
Good help is so hard to find...
--------------------
Spoiled brat
--------------------
I just saw some kid dressed in Pegaso,
tearing around and making messes like 
he wasn't wearing the most expensive 
clothes out there.
What a rich, spoiled brat!
--------------------
Fashionista
--------------------
My Pegaso room is starting to overflow.
Maybe it's time to build another
extension for closet space...
--------------------
The best
--------------------
I can see why rich people love Pegaso.
Everything's just top quality.
The sheen, the texture...
No other brand can compete!
--------------------
Special bag
--------------------
I want to get my hands on Pegaso's new
nylon bag, but apparently I'm not alone...
Guess I'll have to suck it up and 
camp out so I can be there when the
store opens!
--------------------
Rich
--------------------
Rich women wear rich-looking brands
like Pegaso to lure in rich guys who
make them even richer and richer and
OHH I can't keep up.
--------------------
Pegaso 
--------------------
Pegaso shop attendants are amazing!
One look at a customer and they know exactly
if they're there to buy, or just window
shopping. You have to know these things
when you work on commission.
--------------------
Milan
--------------------
I'm going to Milan this year to hit 
the original Pegaso store. I'm going to
buy everything in stock! The shop staff
will never know what hit them.
--------------------
Nylon
--------------------
I love how Pegaso bags weigh almost
nothing. It's as if they have wings!
It's little wonder they named the
brand after Pegasus.
--------------------
Priorities
--------------------
My Pegaso room is full to bursting.
Guess it's time to kick my husband
out of his bedroom!
--------------------
Hong Kong
--------------------
The next time I go to Hong Kong, I'm 
definitely going to visit the original
Dragon Couture store.
--------------------
New line
--------------------
All the shirts from their new line 
are so cool... How can I choose just one?
Hell, I'll just buy them all!
--------------------
Reality
--------------------
The guy in that movie yesterday was
rocking head-to-toe Dragon Couture.
I really want that outfit, but I don't
know if I can pull it off...
--------------------
Work
--------------------
I'm dreading tomorrow's meeting...

Ooh, why don't I wear my Dragon Couture suit
and spice things up a bit?
--------------------
Sofa
--------------------
The couch they have at that Dragon 
Couture store is awesome!
Wonder if it's for sale.
Doubt it, but it never hurts to ask!
--------------------
Career woman
--------------------
When the going gets tough, the tough
still dress sharp and look their best.
It's the mark of a woman in control!
--------------------
Figure
--------------------
I love how Dragon Couture makes me look 
slim. I can see why the Chinese Circus
chose them to make all their costumes.
--------------------
Incense
--------------------
The Dragon Couture store always smells 
so good... I should burn incense at home, 
too, to make my place smell nice.
Hopefully without burning it down...
--------------------
Yoga
--------------------
I should hit Dragon Couture and pick up some
workout clothes for those yoga classes.
But...hmm, DC's based in Hong Kong, right?
Maybe their stuff's a better fit for Tai Chi.
--------------------
One-piece
--------------------
Pegaso's cool and all, but nothing beats
Dragon Couture for casual chic!
--------------------
Makeover
--------------------
I'm bored with my hair color...
Maybe I'll bleach it white like a
big woolly sheep.
--------------------
Big break
--------------------
So Natsu and Akihiro started up
Sheep Heavenly, right?
If they can do it, so can I.
Just call me Natsu-Aki, Jr.!
--------------------
My look
--------------------
There aren't a lot of guys who wear
Sheep Heavenly clothes. Whenever I see 
another dude wearing them, I feel this
weird sense of solidarity.
--------------------
Sticking out
--------------------
Funky clothes can only get you so far.
Hmm, maybe I'll dye my hair.
I could go green, or maybe pink...
This is gonna be awesome!
--------------------
Walk and learn
--------------------
I think the guy I just passed was wearing
Sheep Heavenly. Man, he looked sharp!
Walking around Shibuya is wild.
You learn a ton about fashion trends.
--------------------
Orange
--------------------
It takes a keen eye to know what colors
work well with each other, but sometimes
you need the guts to wear a shirt
that clashes with your pants.
--------------------
Finishing touch
--------------------
Sheep Heavenly is to die for!
Although...hmm. I shoulda worn more pink...
I coulda looked like a complete angel!
--------------------
I know!
--------------------
I'm going for a boyish Sheep Heavenly look
today, but tomorrow, I'll do more of a young, 
fresh thing. Sheep Heavenly's stuff is so
fun<->my closet's like a toy chest!
--------------------
Perfecto!
--------------------
Check me out!
My hair is, like, totally perfect today!
--------------------
Top brand
--------------------
Sheep Heavenly is definitely the 
brand of the year!
The other guys don't even count
as clothes.
--------------------
Sheep
--------------------
Sheep Heavenly clothes are like 
fluffy pieces of bliss!
It's like I'm this sheep?
Covered in a fuzzy coat of happiness?
--------------------
1...2...3...
--------------------
I wonder how many sheep exist in 
sheep heaven.
One sheep, two sheep, three sheep...
ZZZZZZ...
--------------------
Bottom line
--------------------
I should've worn lighter colored pants... 
Chicks love that fresh look.
Makes guys look confident.
--------------------
Difference
--------------------
I don't get it. I bought the exact same 
Natural Puppy outfit that guy on TV was 
wearing, but it looks totally different...
The only thing left is...

Oh. His face.
--------------------
Drama
--------------------
Damn! I wanted to buy what the
guy on TV had on last night...
Shoulda known they'd be sold out already.
--------------------
Convenience
--------------------
Natural Puppy shirts are casual but 
still sharp enough to wear to work<->
a big plus in my book.
--------------------
Sundays
--------------------
It's cool how I can just chill in 
Natural Puppy. Every day's a Sunday 
in these clothes.
--------------------
Watch
--------------------
Wish I could find a one-of-a-kind watch<->
something nobody else has got.
I wanna play the whole outfit safe with Puppy,
then throw 'em with a wild timepiece.
--------------------
Ring
--------------------
I need a big, fat 'n' funky ring<->
so I can dress preppy in Puppy and let my
bling do the real talking.
--------------------
Ms. Popular
--------------------
I'm going to rock full-body Natural Puppy
at tonight's singles party!
All the men will be lusting over me.
I just know it!
--------------------
Too slow!
--------------------
Nooo!
The new arrivals that I saw in that
magazine are already sold out!
--------------------
Natural Puppy
--------------------
The girl working at Natural Puppy dresses
so cute. Wish I could be friends with her.
Maybe she'd give me her mail address...
--------------------
Big break
--------------------
I look so good in Natural Puppy!
Hee, what if I'm scouted by a 
modeling agency?
I should practice saying yes now!
--------------------
Naturally
--------------------
Natural Puppy clothes are so cute and 
sweet! Like real puppies!
--------------------
Puppy
--------------------
Why do their clothes wear 
out so quickly?

Or...maybe I just need to take 
better care of my clothes.
--------------------
Natural Puppy
--------------------
Accessories are a big part of any outfit.
But maybe I'm overdoing it.
The other day, she said I was trying so
hard it was painful to watch...
--------------------
Selection
--------------------
Pavo Real has a huge selection of 
silver jewelry. It's all kinda bulky, 
but classy at the same time.
Hey, kinda like me!
--------------------
Dog lover
--------------------
I wonder if I could buy something for my 
dog here. Dog chains would be smokin'!
--------------------
Versatile
--------------------
Pavo Real jewelry even looks good
with THIS outfit. So versatile!
How does the designer do it?
--------------------
Clink, clink
--------------------
Pavo Real has some great jewelry... 
but man, they're heavy! After wearing
these eight pieces all day, I think
I can skip the gym.
--------------------
Visionary
--------------------
Pavo Real is Spanish for "peacock."
I wonder if they sell any peacock 
feather-shaped accessories...
If not, I can always try to make my own!
--------------------
Gimme
--------------------
If I ace my next test, I'm gonna 
have Daddy buy me a Pavo Real ring!
I totally deserve it!
--------------------
My wish
--------------------
Pavo Real accessories are so gorgeous!
It's a shame they don't make clothes...
What I would give to be covered in 
Pavo Real from head to toe!
--------------------
Moonstones
--------------------
Pavo Real uses moonstones in their jewelry.
They're cute AND they bring you luck!
Bonus!
--------------------
Emeralds
--------------------
Only Pavo Real jewelry uses emeralds 
that are so finely cut and so...green!
I wish I could make my own original 
jewelry with stones as nice as these.
--------------------
Hawt
--------------------
Whoa, what a hottie!
She's working that D+B outfit!
I gotta go say hi.
--------------------
Less is more
--------------------
D+B clothes are skim-py!
Nothing puts me in a better mood than 
seeing a girl wearing clothes that barely 
cover her up. It's times like these that
make me glad I was born a man!
--------------------
Present
--------------------
My girlfriend's birthday is coming up.
Maybe I'll get her some new D+B threads.
Time to hit the pachinko machines for 
extra dough!
--------------------
She rocks
--------------------
My girl rocks!
She's smart and fun to be with!
Now if only she looked good in D+B...
Or is that asking too much?
--------------------
Tank top
--------------------
Man, this D+B tank top was made for me!
The fit is perfect<->I know I look good.
--------------------
Irresistable
--------------------
Those months of dieting really paid off!
I finally managed to squeeze myself into 
this D+B outfit. There's no way he can 
resist me in this!

Wait, but what if he doesn't like D+B?
--------------------
Tacky
--------------------
I can't believe that girl's wearing D+B!
She's showing way too much skin<->it's 
tacky! Doesn't she know that D+B looks 
good on chicks like me, not her?
--------------------
Matching
--------------------
No way! That girl is wearing the exact
same outfit as me! Why is D+B so 
popular!? Ugh, I'd better make sure to 
keep my distance.
--------------------
Uh-oh
--------------------
Shoot! Where'd the time go?
I'm gonna be late to the big D+B event!
This time, I'll make 100 friends for sure!
--------------------
Ring
--------------------
I so want that D+B limited edition ring!
My friends would be so jealous if I got
my hands on one! I've been hitting the
store daily, but they're always sold out...
Today makes what, three months now?
--------------------
Shreddin'
--------------------
When I shred, I wear Wild Boar.
Figures a board freak like Kyo'd pick
there to work. Dude seriously knows
what skaters want.
--------------------
Street dancing
--------------------
Wild Boar is great for street dancing!
All eyes are gonna be on me and my
threads!
Now, I've just gotta learn to dance...
--------------------
Joy ride?
--------------------
Maybe I'll go to the park and 
ride my board for a bit.
Ooh, but I don't wanna ruin my clothes...
Or my board...
--------------------
Yo!
--------------------
Yo dawg!
Check it, I am tricked out!
Wild Boar is the shizz-o!
--------------------
B-boy
--------------------
Do these make me look like a B-boy?
I'm actually O-positive, so I'm kinda
unsure if I can pull off the look...
--------------------
Real men
--------------------
Hell with all that fancy crap.
Wild Boar talks straight from the junk!
That's what real men are all about!
--------------------
All good
--------------------
Wild Boar's a popular brand, huh?
I just got complimented on my clothes.
I only bought them 'cause they're
baggy enough to cover my gut...
--------------------
Pink
--------------------
The pink Wild Boar uses is totally hot!
A girl's gotta wear pink, yeah?
I love how there's this harshness to it
you don't see in other brands.
--------------------
Soul
--------------------
Yeah, Wild Boar's got soul! Just wearing 
their clothes makes you wanna dance.
Come on, let's groove!
--------------------
Shake it
--------------------
I can't explain it, but 
when I wear Wild Boar, it makes me 
want to shake it like a wild woman!
--------------------
Annoying
--------------------
I changed my hairstyle to match my Wild 
Boar threads, but it's such a pain to
maintain! Maybe I should just style 
it the way it was before...
--------------------
Satisfaction
--------------------
I finally got the Wild Boar limited 
edition ring!
'Course, now I have to subsist on bread
and water for the next three weeks,
but it's totally worth it!
--------------------
Street style
--------------------
I totally need to keep in shape to 
pull off this street style look.
Good thing I love to shake my booty!
--------------------
Moves
--------------------
I can't believe he said I look more like a
cheerleader than a real hip-hop dancer!
Punk hater ain't got a clue!
I'ma practice up, then show him I got
more moves than he ever will!
--------------------
What's hip
--------------------
Do some people get dressed in their sleep?
Their clothes are so tacky!
They should wear Hip Snake!
Basic colors are the best, no joke.
--------------------
Vintage
--------------------
I wanna buy some vintage clothes, 
but I can't afford them!
I wonder if the jeans I wore in 
high school count as vintage...
--------------------
Old or new?
--------------------
At a glance, Hip Snake looks almost 
second-hand, but the stitching is 
amazing and the fit is perfect.
It's cool to see old styles make a 
comeback, but as better-quality clothes!
--------------------
Nostalgia
--------------------
I can't believe I made Mom cry!
I didn't know wearing these clothes would
remind her of Dad when he was young...
--------------------
Music
--------------------
If Hip Snake sold instruments, 
I'd buy me a white acoustic guitar.
Sure, I don't know how to play, but for
Hip Snake? I'd practice my butt off!
--------------------
Happiness
--------------------
What a first! A cute young lady just
told me she loved my clothes! Odd...
I've been wearing the same clothes
for 30 years.

I wonder what a "hip snake" is...
--------------------
Originality
--------------------
I love how original Hip Snake is.
Their clothes aren't for everyone<->they're 
for hipsters who like lurking in small,
cozy cafés reading poetry.
--------------------
Denim pants
--------------------
I love how flared these jeans are!
They kinda remind me of what people 
practice kendo in. 
Maybe I should take it up, too.
--------------------
Psychedelic
--------------------
These clothes look retro but hip at the 
same time. The colors and patterns are 
so psychedelic!
--------------------
The 60s
--------------------
Hip Snake is gonna release a new line 
of pants all in 60's style.
I can't wait!
Hmm, wonder if a search through my closet 
would turn something similar up...
--------------------
Sunglasses  
--------------------
Sunglasses are a must-have accessory 
when wearing Hip Snake.
Preferably something with big, round 
lenses à la aviator shades.
--------------------
Buckles
--------------------
Hip Snake's belt buckles are always so
distinct! It's fun to see just how far
they can push it.
--------------------
Hmm...
--------------------
Jupiter of the Monkey rocks!
But do the shop attendants really have to 
rap when talking to customers?
--------------------
Sports
--------------------
I always wear J of the M when playing
sports. They collaborate with sporting
brands for a lot of their stuff, so their
stuff's always really functional.
--------------------
Futsal
--------------------
Now that I got a futsal team together,
we need uniforms! Ooh, I'll go put
something together at J of the M.
--------------------
Peas in a pod
--------------------
I can't believe all of us wore J of the M
to last night's party...
What can I say? Great minds think alike!
--------------------
Be careful
--------------------
J of the M clothes are totally cool, 
but you have to know which pieces to 
match together, or you just end up 
looking sloppy.
--------------------
Hot guys
--------------------
Yowza, Jupiter monkeys are so my type!
I'm gonna pop by the store again today
just to check out the hot guys shopping
there!
--------------------
Plusses
--------------------
J of the M doesn't make ladies' sizes,
so their stuff's a little big, but...
that means it covers up the extra gut
action, so it's all good.
--------------------
His and hers
--------------------
Woo! Matching his-and-hers J of the M
striped tops, and tickets to watch the martial
arts tournament with my boyfriend today!
I'm the luckiest girl in the world! 
--------------------
Prince
--------------------
I love the Prince's new hip-hop album!
I MUST have the J of the M jacket he's
wearing on the cover!
I just HAVE to!
--------------------
My crush
--------------------
I was wearing J of the M the other day
and my crush complimented me!
I only bought the clothes because I
wanted our wardrobes to match...
--------------------
My idol
--------------------
Yamazaki, the Tigre Punks designer,
is 60, but she still dresses punk.
She's freakin' badass!
I wanna be just like her when I'm old.
...Except male.
--------------------
Rage
--------------------
This place is unbearable!
Everyone's dressed up all pretty,
begging for attention...
Time for a good old-fashioned
punk-style kick to the junk!
--------------------
Frustration
--------------------
Argh!
I can't shake this impulse to just...
break everything!
I need some good punk music to calm
me down!
--------------------
Scene
--------------------
My girlfriend bought me these clothes 
but I don't think they're for me...
I look like a wannabe scenester.
--------------------
Designer
--------------------
Man, Tigre Punks' designer's got to have
led an insane life. I bet she's covered
in scars, inside and out. Punk's all
about surviving through the pain, right?
--------------------
Punk  
--------------------
Punk's an attitude.
Shredded clothes don't make you punk.
It comes down to whether or not you got
punk in your soul.
--------------------
I'm scary?
--------------------
I can't believe I made a kid cry 
the other night! Do I really look 
that scary with this spiky dog collar?
--------------------
Bad boys
--------------------
I love how people who are punk 
look so dangerous.
It's so true that girls like bad boys!
--------------------
Jacket
--------------------
Real punks keep that leather jacket on
no matter how hot it gets!
--------------------
One brand
--------------------
Tigre Punks is the only brand that matters.
Everything else is rags. The whole world
should just go Tigre.

...So I don't catch all these stares.
--------------------
My dream
--------------------
You better keep your distance.
Stay back, or you're gonna get hurt!
I'm gonna become an awesome singer all
on my own, so don't you dare try to help!
--------------------
Kindness
--------------------
Everyone has their share of problems.
I just want to lift their spirits a
little by singing great punk songs.
--------------------
Respect
--------------------
Tora Ana Yamazaki, you are my idol!
Tigre is blessed to have you designing.
I'm gonna keep wearing these clothes,
even when I'm old and wrinkly like you!
--------------------
Weak
--------------------
Lookit 'em flock like sheep.
Don't they get it? The only way to start
living your own life is to experience
true solitude.
--------------------
Blog
--------------------
I can't believe Princess K's blog was 
updated fifty times yesterday.

She must have been having a slow day...
--------------------
Goth-loli
--------------------
Few people really understand gothic
lolita fashion. The beauty is hard to 
grasp because it veers from generic 
definitions of "pretty" or "cute."
--------------------
A vampire!?
--------------------
Today I'm dressed like a vampire...
What I would give to sink my teeth into 
the necks of pretty girls everywhere!

...What's wrong with me!?
--------------------
I get it!
--------------------
The main character of this comic is 
wearing clothes based on Lapin Angelique.
That's why he looks so much like me!
--------------------
Something
--------------------
I'm covered in Lapin Angelique but 
something's missing...
It needs a little something extra<->
maybe some bandages? An eye patch?
--------------------
Destiny
--------------------
Where is my beautiful princess 
dressed in Lapin Angelique?
Your prince is here!
--------------------
Match
--------------------
I didn't realize that band's costumes 
were from Lapin Angelique.
No wonder I like them, we have similar
tastes in music AND fashion!
--------------------
Military goth
--------------------
Lapin Angelique's new line is...
military goth camo?
Huh... Their mingling of drabs is
certainly eye-opening!
--------------------
Fears
--------------------
I feel like a princess in Lapin Angelique.
I hope no one mistakes me for royalty and
tries to kidnap me...
Ooh, but then my prince would ride in
on his white horse and save me{0154}
--------------------
My fix
--------------------
I feel faint...
I need a dose of Lapin Angelique!
I simply must run to the store and see 
Princess K this very moment!
--------------------
Hopefully
--------------------
I hope goth lolita fashion becomes as 
popular in Shibuya as it is in Harajuku.
--------------------
Headdress
--------------------
This headdress is kinda dull.
I should go home and spice it up a little.
--------------------
Foundation
--------------------
I tried out a light-colored foundation 
today to match my white blouse, but it's
so pale! I look like a ghost!
--------------------
Ugh!
--------------------
What is WRONG with that girl?
Is she gonna pass out or something?
Seriously, have a sandwich!
--------------------
Girly girl
--------------------
I don't know why I've never been into
frills and ribbons before<->they're so cute!
--------------------
Mom!
--------------------
My mom said I should stop dressing like 
anime characters.
What is she talking about?
Doesn't she know the anime characters 
are imitating ME?
--------------------
Destiny
--------------------
Where is my handsome prince 
dressed in Lapin Angelique?
Come on, your princess is right here!
--------------------
Confidence?
--------------------
Mus Rattus is real affordable and 
looks pretty good for the price.
Of course, when you look this good,
it doesn't really matter what you wear.
--------------------
Cheap!
--------------------
Shopping at Mus Rattus is great 'cause
it leaves money to buy other stuff.
I mean, there's an HDTV, video games,
an HDD recorder, more DVDs, some
action figures, a new cell phone...
--------------------
Shopping spree
--------------------
I just went on a shopping spree at Mus
Rattus. It's not my fault my old clothes
remind me of my ex.
Considering how frequent my breakups are,
I'm glad their stuff's affordable...
--------------------
Date
--------------------
Hmm, where should I take my girl today...
Maybe I'll take her shopping and buy her 
some clothes. Mus Rattus would be cool 
because I can actually afford their stuff...
--------------------
Sacrifices
--------------------
Guess I should buy myself some clothes...
But I'd rather get some for my online 
avatar. OK, I'll get myself something 
cheap from Mus Rattus, and something
swank for my character!
--------------------
Mowzy
--------------------
Those Mowzy shirts are sooo cute!
I'm going to get one in every color,
and wear them every day!
--------------------
Socks
--------------------
Brr, my feet are freezing! 
Poor circulation is the pits. 
Better head to Mus Rattus and buy their 
3-for-1 socks<->and wear all three pairs.
--------------------
Costume
--------------------
I need a costume for drama class...
Guess I'll do what I always do<->
buy Mus  Rattus and fix it up a little
to fit the character I play.
That shop's a thespian's best friend!
--------------------
More
--------------------
I love Mus Rattus clothes for their 
simple designs and cheap prices.
Life isn't all about wearing designer 
clothes. There's so much more.
--------------------
Back off
--------------------
I wish everyone would get off my back 
about the way I dress!
I AM a fashionable person!
I just like the simplicity of Mus Rattus
clothes, OK!?
--------------------
Inside info
--------------------
Man, Gatito threads are so slick.
I mean, it figures...
CAT's their buyer.
--------------------
Identity
--------------------
Your clothes are your identity.
That's why I only wear Gatito and 
I'll keep wearing Gatito till the end!

Just wish I owned more than one outfit.
--------------------
Future
--------------------
I can't believe Gatito's getting so big.
It's such a niche brand, but it's all over
Shibuya these days...
I knew this was the city of
trends, but I'm impressed!
--------------------
POV
--------------------
Gatito designs always surprise me.
They're so unique and one-of-a-kind.
It takes stones to put stuff like that
out on the shelves.
--------------------
Passion
--------------------
Gatito's buyer is the real person to be 
thankful for. They hunt down the hottest
threads and sweet-talk the owners into
selling. Every article's got a story.
It's epic!
--------------------
The look
--------------------
Gatito clothes are so funky, I'm probably 
the only one who can wear them and look
good. Well, me and maybe the staff at the 
Shibuya Game Show?
--------------------
Problem
--------------------
I spent all my savings on this Gatito 
jacket, but it doesn't go with any other
clothing brands!
Guess once you start wearing Gatito, 
you gotta go all the way.
--------------------
Hunt
--------------------
Gatito doesn't have its own store,
so if you want to buy their clothes,
you have to go search other shops for
them. It's like hunting for treasure!
--------------------
Mystery
--------------------
Huh... No one knows who the designer 
for Gatito is? How mysterious!
--------------------
Funny
--------------------
Why can't everyone see why Gatito 
is so great?

...Not that I'm sure I totally get it either,
but still.
--------------------
Gofer
--------------------
Sucks that I have to wake up at 5 tomorrow
to buy that rare item...
But that guy from class won't introduce me
to CAT unless I do. No pain, no gain!
--------------------
300 yen left
--------------------
Urrrg. One more week to go.
How am I gonna make it through?

I know! I'll live off free samples
at the supermarket!
--------------------
Love phone
--------------------
If I ask her out from the phone booth
in front of Molco, she's SURE to say yes!

OK, here goes... I'm gonna do it!
I'm really gonna do it!
--------------------
Plan B
--------------------
Tomorrow's the big game.
I haven't been sleeping well, so I'll probably
be feeling way out of it.
Maybe the girlfriend's special garlic cake
will give me a boost...
--------------------
Dry eye
--------------------
Urg, I spent too much time in front of
the monitor! My eyes are killing me!
I must've forgotten to blink...
--------------------
Check me out
--------------------
Sweet!
All the girls looking my way are smiling!

Finally, my Don Juan era can begin<->
and it's all thanks to these new platform
shoes!
--------------------
So that's why
--------------------
Aw, dammit!
My clothes are on backwards!
--------------------
Refined
--------------------
I've been eatin' at a café every day<->
highfalutin, fancy stuff, just like an
honest-to-goodness city person!

But folks is still gimmin' me the evil eye.
It's my clothes, ain't it? I just know it!
--------------------
Rap
--------------------
Damn, all the rhymes I think of
are played out. But I need something<->
I can't lose to Okada in the next rap battle.
That backpacking, no-talent clown!
--------------------
Adjusting
--------------------
I've been undercover here long enough now
that I can finally tell the different types of
Shibuya kids apart.

Aha! There's the suspect!
--------------------
What now?
--------------------
Ugh, my poor stomach.
What's the point of having a good store
around for herbal medicine if the guy has
to LIKE you? That's not fair, I say!

Just not to him, 'cause he's scary.
--------------------
Ramen
--------------------
Ramen, ramen... I guess I eat it every day.
Maybe I should try something new...

What am I thinking!?
Unless it's greasy, it's just not food!
Yup. Ramen's the way to go.
--------------------
Actually...
--------------------
It makes sense.
I go into the shops almost every day.
I should've noticed the owners were brothers:
same last name, and they even resemble
each other. They're practically triplets.
--------------------
Part-time job
--------------------
Where should I apply?
Between this and that other place,
it's hard to make my mind up.
They both look fun...

I know! I'll ask Reaper Creeper!
--------------------
War of flyers
--------------------
Now the Towa Records and AMX guys
both claim they're on a "road trip" to
perfect their writing.

Um, what? As far as I can tell, they're both
still behind the counter every day.
--------------------
Lunch break
--------------------
Ahh...
I think I'll go to the park and take a nap!
Hope my favorite bench is open...

Probably not, though.
Lately that seat's a hot contest.
--------------------
Just wait!
--------------------
Yesterday's wedding was nice.
But when my baby and I get hitched, the
ceremony's gonna leave the guests weeping.

Heh heh, yeah.
Time to go home and get planning!
--------------------
Ring
--------------------
I hope my girl likes it...

It's old, but most family heirlooms are, right?
I know Gram would be happy I'm giving it
to someone who means so much to me.
--------------------
Heian beauty
--------------------
My little sis, she'd be beating the boys
away with sticks<->
heh, if pasty skin and black teeth were
still popular!
--------------------
Crossroads
--------------------
How am I gonna decide?
Today's the girlfriend's birthday, but I'm
supposed to go watch the soccer match.
Sure, I like her and all...but SOCCER!
--------------------
Captain Loser
--------------------
"Slammurai" wouldn't be half as good a
program without the loser hero.
Seriously, a show where the team leader's
codename is "Dead"? Guy's screwed!
--------------------
Air
--------------------
Kyo's boarding at the park the other day
was supremely awesome.
That sweet backside 360 he pulled off? Hot!
Wish I could get air like that...
--------------------
Twins
--------------------
At the singles party yesterday, some girl
was like, "Hey, you remind me of Mt. Fuji!"

Is that supposed to be a compliment?
--------------------
She smiled!
--------------------
Dr. Fumiko smiled when she spoke to me!
I think she's got the hots for me.
I'm totally gonna ask her to dinner!
--------------------
Stunning?
--------------------
Too bad...
She looked good from afar, but up close?
Far from good.
--------------------
Rough
--------------------
I can't get her out of my mind...
How am I supposed to concentrate on work
when I've got it this bad?

Oh! Maybe it'd be easier if I just
broke up with her!
--------------------
Idol
--------------------
A lot of people say my older sister is
like an idol singer.

The washed-up, failed kind...
--------------------
Wrong idea
--------------------
Crap, how could she mistake that for
a pickup line? The only thing I want to
slam with her is some Tin Pin!
I gotta practice for the slam-off!
--------------------
Mr. Future
--------------------
When I asked her out, she said,
"Sorry, but modern times will never
catch up with you."

That shows how awesome I am, right?
Yup, waaay too awesome to score!
--------------------
Caught?
--------------------
Shoot, I messed up while distressing
my jeans and cut them too much!

I hope no one notices...
This is my only pair of pants.
I've gotta wear them either way...
--------------------
Knockoffs
--------------------
I hear you can find knockoffs of the
school uniforms those rich St. Michael's
kids wear.

Wish I had one... Chicks dig money!
--------------------
Princely
--------------------
My girlfriend looks just like Eiji Oji.

Wait.

Is she really a woman!?
--------------------
Ouendaaan!
--------------------
You know what we need for Sports Day?
A cheer squad! That means uniforms...
Wonder if I could pick up something
like the squads' head honchos wear at
one of these stores...
--------------------
Avast ye!
--------------------
They say pirate fashion is set to take off!
Better track down a pirate hat ASAP.

Hmm, but then again, I've got that sailor suit...
Maybe I'm covered.
--------------------
Dark matter
--------------------
Today's scientists have only identified
about 4% of all matter in the universe.
The other 96% is made up of dark matter!
--------------------
Chubby bunny
--------------------
Yumi's performance the other day was wild!
She ate ten marshmallows at once, without
choking or anything!

She really has changed since starting this
play<->for the better.
--------------------
Finished!
--------------------
Hee hee, my new scent turned out perfect!
One splash of this and I'll be irresistible!
--------------------
Smells...good?
--------------------
Oh, it's that perfume from the other day.
Wait, it's a little different...
Like it's developed...evolved?
--------------------
Hat
--------------------
Shopping for the right hat is tough...
I can't find anything that works for me<->
but I'm not buying a hat unless
it's the right one!
--------------------
Happy!
--------------------
Wow...he likes me! He really likes me!
Now we can be together forever and ever!

I feel like I'm skipping through Shibuya
on the clouds!
--------------------
Why not?
--------------------
I'm a celebrity<->
why doesn't anyone seem to recognize me!?

I'm not in disguise... I've even been on TV
a few times! Maybe they're just too shy...
--------------------
WTF?
--------------------
So he comes up to me and says,
"You're venom, baby, and I've contracted
your poison."

What is that!? A compliment?
A put-down? I don't know what to feel!
--------------------
Sold out
--------------------
That Shibu-Q Heads trio's concert was
completely sold out. Are they about to
make it big?

Really, their vocalist, Iwata,
carries the band.
--------------------
Catty
--------------------
CAT won't do interviews that show his face.
Why not? Is he that butt-ugly? Or...

Don't tell me CAT's actually a cat!?
--------------------
Funny...
--------------------
What is wrong with me lately?
I'll be pondering something important,
and then some random word shoves its way
into my head...

It throws me off for the whole day!
--------------------
Come on...
--------------------
Seriously, when is this misanga bracelet
going to fall off?

I want my wish to come true!
I didn't even know they made thread this
strong...
--------------------
Tote bag
--------------------
Hrm, my bag is already full of stuff.
I should've brought that tote I got at the
Shibuya Game Show.
It could fit all kinds of swag.
--------------------
Clones?
--------------------
So then, CAT's this group of twenty
different creators...all with the same face?

Makes sense...I think?
Is that even possible?
--------------------
Wings
--------------------
I thought I saw someone with wings
the other day...

No more caffeine.
--------------------
777
--------------------
I wonder where 777 lives...
I hung around after his last show to ask,
but he just smiled and changed the subject.

Next time, I'm gonna follow him home.
--------------------
Destiny
--------------------
I wish I could track down that gentleman
who escorted me to Grandfather's store...
Thank goodness for the few chivalrous men
still left in the world!

If only I'd inquired about his phone number...
--------------------
Stupid!
--------------------
I forgot the Prince was MC'ing that radio
show today...
Why didn't I think to set the recorder?
I'll just have to head over to the studio
and peek in.
--------------------
No question...
--------------------
Every day the voices in my head get louder...

OK, that's it.
From now on, I'M gonna talk to THEM first!
--------------------
Pointless
--------------------
If I go with a cell phone designed by CAT,
is there really any point in me sticking
decorations on it?
--------------------
Just like that
--------------------
Huh?

No waaay!
Since when was this shop here?
The stores here change way too fast...
--------------------
Mentality
--------------------
Whew, I'm beat. I want to go home<->
but nah, my room's a mess.

Better I hit a manga café than go home
and make it any dirtier!
--------------------
Dreams
--------------------
If I go to the beauty salon now,
I'll fall asleep for sure.

But then again...at least in my dreams
I can hit on that hunky stylist!
--------------------
New post!
--------------------
Ooh, the Prince posted on his blog!
Let's see... "Today I had ramen for lunch."
Ramen, huh...

Hey, the shop he went to is here in Shibuya!
I'm gonna go check it out.
--------------------
Royal worries
--------------------
The Prince wrote in his blog that he's
starting voice lessons.
Guess he noticed he was off key...
But still, that's what he's known for<->
I don't want him to change!
--------------------
Salt
--------------------
Hmm, I could use a snack.
Good thing I picked up those fries.

...Oh, no! I left my can of salt at home!
Good thing I have some ketchup packets
on me. Better than nothing!
--------------------
Missionary
--------------------
Oh, no...
I'm not even close to reaching my goal of
making 100 people happy!

At this rate, Shibuya will become full of
sad people...
--------------------
Why?
--------------------
There are an awful lot of rumors
surrounding that café on Cat Street...
I wonder why.
--------------------
Too much
--------------------
Ugh, why is my throat still killing me?
Karaoke?

I'm still doing eight-hour sessions, but I
started bringing a friend to split the time!
Shouldn't that help?
--------------------
I'm getting...
--------------------
Goosebumps!
What's all this bad energy I'm picking up?
It's like something else is here.
Something...not human...but something that
USED to be human!
--------------------
Bad girl
--------------------
My honeybear said,
"Don't get any thinner," so I got fat.
When he saw me, he was, like,
"Sweet! I'll get fat, too!" Heh, unreal!
--------------------
Scouted!
--------------------
Yes! I've finally been approached!
Next stop, idol city!
I don't care how much I have to suffer,
I'm gonna do this!
--------------------
Uncluttering
--------------------
They say taking out the trash makes you
super lucky. OK, look out, world!
Soon as I get home, I'm throwing out, like,
half my apartment!
--------------------
Deadline
--------------------
My submission deadline passed.
But I don't want to think about it,
so I'm out here instead...
--------------------
Box set
--------------------
I can't find the game anywhere...
Wish I managed to reserve a copy. I tried!
But even the presale sold right out...
--------------------
Huh?
--------------------
Why'd I come out here again?
Something important, but I can't for the
life of me remember what...
--------------------
Tin Pin
--------------------
This time I'm gonna win for sure!
I can't face the shame of ten straight losses.

Man, what am I doing wrong?
--------------------
Shades
--------------------
My little brother never takes his
sunglasses off, even in the house...
We're related! It's not like I don't know
what he really looks like.

Wait, do I?
--------------------
Duck
--------------------
Where are you, dear old Mr. Ducky?
Without you, bath time's just no fun!
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.
Just come back home!
--------------------
Solid
--------------------
That Tin Pin toy they sell, the Solid Slammer<->
the one that looks like a pin launcher...
Does it actually help your game?

Nah, it's probably just to get in the mood.
--------------------
English?

--------------------
Confidence
--------------------
Aieee, so nervous...
I hope the movies was a good idea.
What if she doesn't like the movies?

Or what if she doesn't like guys who
can't make up their minds!?
--------------------
Yay!
--------------------
Ahh, the start of another beautiful day!
I'm so psyched about my amazing posture.
That full-body cast really is working!
--------------------
Just in case
--------------------
Crap...
Did I lock the door this morning?
The more I think about it,
the less sure I am.
Better go back and check...
even if it is two hours round trip!
--------------------
Train fare!
--------------------
Oh, no! Sold out!?
I was dying to play that game!
Plus, I wasted money on the ride over...
--------------------
Courage
--------------------
"Hey, you! Don't litter!"
That's what I'd like to say, but I'm chicken.
If only I had a bigger pair of rocks...

For me to throw.
--------------------
Festivals
--------------------
It's that time of the year again...
The time for festivals, and with it,
my time to shine.
I'm gonna be a stage-building fiend!
--------------------
Splat
--------------------
Man, who thought making ice cream
scoops round was a good idea?
I asked for two scoops, and the
top one rolled right off!
--------------------
My dream
--------------------
Look at all these fancy skyscrapers...
Someday, I'm gonna be rich and famous
and live in one!
And every night, I'll lounge in a smoking
jacket and carry a brandy snifter...
Hurr hurr hurr!
--------------------
Crash!
--------------------
Oh, snap! I dropped my laptop!
Is the data OK!?
--------------------
Bushy
--------------------
Damn, it's already back?
I just shaved this morning...

Gotta get to a bathroom and
take care of this!
--------------------
100 yen
--------------------
How can I make this make me rich?
Lotto tickets, I guess.
Or maybe I should buy a pin and
hope it becomes rare later...
--------------------
Two hours
--------------------
What the hell! A line that long,
I figured the place would be great.
Boy, was I wrong.
Now I need a drink to get rid of the
aftertaste. Hmm, let's see which café
has the longest lines!
--------------------
He waved
--------------------
So of course I waved back,
but the guy just gave me a funny look.
Guess he was waving to somebody
behind me.

Ugh, so embarrassing...
--------------------
Sweets
--------------------
Now that I'm comfortable with being
the only grown man in the sweet shops,
nothing can stop me!

Today...I think I'll try that taiyaki parfait.
--------------------
Wasteland
--------------------
Where are all the game shops?
Comic shops? ARCADES!?

How do these people live?
--------------------
Plastic world
--------------------
Dang it, forgot my wallet!
Well, no worries. As long as I've got my
train pass, I just swipe it and<->WHAT!?
Did I drop it somewhere?
How the heck am I supposed to get home?
--------------------
10{0136} spice
--------------------
Ye gods, that curry!
I'm sweating like a pig and my
whole mouth stings...
Why did I order so much extra spice?
Even my mind is on fire!
--------------------
Silver streak
--------------------
Huh?
What was that glint in the sky just now?
A plane? Wait... Not a UFO!?

Better take a picture just in case!
--------------------
Third eye
--------------------
I have eyes on the back of my head.
I can FEEL what's happening behind me<->
so when a celeb shows up in Shibuya,
I'm always the first to ID them!
--------------------
Hottie
--------------------
Whoa, that girl was FINE.
She looked like that idol in those
commercials... Whoa!
No way it was really her...was it?
I mean, lots of people look like that...
--------------------
Need a rub
--------------------
Oww...my tootsies are killing me!
Wonder if there's a place around here
I can get a decent foot massage...

Gotta watch out, 'cause if it's done
poorly, I'll end up hurting even more.
--------------------
One track
--------------------
Dammit, song, get out of my head!
I keep singing out loud by accident,
and the people around look at me
like I'm nuts!
Why do "denpa" tunes have to be so
deliberately weird?
--------------------
Bad note
--------------------
Hmm... I really went too far yesterday.
Those things I said to her, I didn't
even mean them...
How do I face her now?
--------------------
Rare treat
--------------------
Shibuya Special Sauce<->score!
This'll make the perfect gift, but...
how does it taste?

I'm gonna give this to my buddy anyway...
He won't care if I try a little.
--------------------
Cool
--------------------
The shops around here are super trendy...
A little too trendy.
I don't think I'm cool enough to go inside.
--------------------
Where?
--------------------
The restaurant should be around
here somewhere...
but it's impossible to find!
Which of these side streets do
I turn down?
--------------------
Powerful
--------------------
There's just something about Shibuya...
All these people coming together,
wrapped in their own hopes and dreams...
It's just a powerful feeling.
--------------------
Hideaways
--------------------
I told my folks, let's explore and find
more unknown restaurants...and they said,
"What's wrong with the family ramen shop?"

Well, there's a difference between
"unknown" and "deserted"...
--------------------
Can't win
--------------------
Ugh, work is such a pain.
I oughta just quit. Then I can do whatever
I feel like as much as I feel like.

Ugh, that sounds like a pain, too.
--------------------
Go-karts
--------------------
That go-kart race was amazing!
I wasn't half bad, either...
Maybe my destiny is to become a racer!
--------------------
Dance
--------------------
Ooh! I just thought of a new move!
I gotta call Miki and tell her!
Oh, wait<->I guess she's still at work.
--------------------
Diet
--------------------
Mmm, what is that delicious smell?
Crepes? Donuts? Muffins?
Arg, now I'm hungry.
Dieting is hard... Can I get away with
dried sweet potatoes?
--------------------
Fancy burger
--------------------
All those toppings make them
too thick to fit in your mouth!
If you have to take the thing apart
to eat it, why make the burger
in the first place?
--------------------
Urban legends
--------------------
Hee hee, finally!
I caved and bought that book of
urban legends. Let's see what's inside.

A river running beneath Shibuya?
Pfft, yeah, right! This book is junk.
--------------------
Hustled
--------------------
What have I done?
I was so busy checking the guy out
that I signed a really sketchy contract.
Thank goodness for Japan's
"cooling-off" laws<->I can still bail!
--------------------
Gross
--------------------
Yesterday I got the nastiest present.
They told me it was a delicacy,
but come on!
The thing was a bug with a plant
growing out of it. Eww!
Am I really that hated?
--------------------
Real age
--------------------
Oh ho ho...
Incredible, isn't it?
See the restorative powers of
royal jelly?

No one realizes that I'm really 58!
--------------------
Picky
--------------------
Blech! This crepe is filled with
custard cream!
You use whipped cream in crepes,
everybody knows that!
Ugh, if I wanted to eat custard,
I'd buy pudding...
--------------------
Squish?
--------------------
Ack! What did I just step on?
Wh-wh-what's this gooey sensation?
Stay calm, play it cool...
I'll just scrape my shoes against the
ground as I walk...
--------------------
Fail
--------------------
Ack! I flew out of the house this morning
'cause I was late, and forgot something
really important<->drawing in my eyebrows!

I'd better head back...
--------------------
Compliment
--------------------
I'm so happy! The guy I like said
something nice about me.
"Kids and pets must love you." Hee hee!

Huh?
Wait a sec, what about GUYS!?
--------------------
Santa
--------------------
This is the first year I've had a boyfriend
for Christmas. Finally, I can fulfill my
fantasy: to have my own personal Santa!

If he dressed up in the suit...
and maybe let me sit on his lap...
--------------------
All-nighter?
--------------------
I'm glad my friends care enough to
ask me if I'm getting enough sleep,
or if I'm feeling sick...
but I'm totally fine!
What, is my face puffy or something?
--------------------
Male friend
--------------------
Ahh, it's so nice to be taken out by a
guy who isn't trying to prove anything.

But then again, if the guys who ARE
interested mistake us for a couple...
--------------------
Black speck?
--------------------
Waaaaaaah!
C-C-C-C-COCKROACH!!!
--------------------
Passing
--------------------
I knew dressing up as a girl would be fun!
And not one person has caught on<->
proof that my beauty passes the test!

Ooh, I could get used to this...
--------------------
Paranormal
--------------------
Am I tired or what?
I keep seeing people vanish into thin air
and then materialize right back out of it...

Something like that happened the
other day in Udagawa, too...
--------------------
90 calories
--------------------
All right, I can have another
90 calories today.
Should I go for ramen? Ice cream?
Ooh, if I'm getting ice cream,
I should hit that dessert buffet<->
90 minutes, all you can eat!
--------------------
Date?
--------------------
Another mail? Get it through your
head, man: I don't like you!
Besides, I already promised another guy
I'd go see fireworks with him.
Speaking of which<->I'd better hurry
home and fire up that dating sim!
--------------------
Veiled insult?
--------------------
People keep telling me my makeup
looks great...but is that something
I should be proud of?

I mean, isn't that basically saying
I'm good at not looking like me?
--------------------
Indulging
--------------------
Hmm, what should I get for a gift?
Cakes work, but donuts and waffles
also have their charms...

Eh, you know what? I'm getting 'em all!
It's the least I can do for myself!
--------------------
Old shirt
--------------------
Hoo boy, not good...
I figured, what the hey, I'd try wearing
this shirt from two years ago...
but it's way too tight!
Hmm, maybe if I stop breathing for<->
OH, NO! It ripped!
--------------------
Dinner
--------------------
Mmm, I want to eat fancy Italian... 
Or some five-star French<->
that would be good, too!

Too bad I'm being delusional.
My food budget is, what, 500 yen a day?
--------------------
Soothing
--------------------
Coming to Shibuya always calms me down.
All the people, the glittering lights<->
it's like nothing in this world!
--------------------
Clubbing
--------------------
Clubbing is so much fun!
You never know what sort of people
will turn up!
What better place to people-watch?
--------------------
Attractive
--------------------
Heh heh, the guys can't take their
eyes off me today.
I must look stunning in this outfit
I just bought at<->huh?

Oh, I forgot to take the tags off...
--------------------
Discrete
--------------------
It's probably time to redo my lipstick...
Why aren't there any bathrooms around?
Whatever, I'll just check it here.

Oh! My lips have chocolate on them!
--------------------
Apartment
--------------------
It'd be so sweet to live in Shibuya<->
I could ride everywhere on my bike!
But rent's what, 200,000 yen a month
for a two-bedroom?
I should just save up for a car.
--------------------
Blew it?
--------------------
Ugh, my poor hair... Frizzy hair is the worst!
Well, at least it's nice out...
As soon as it rains, I turn into Afrodite...
--------------------
Shock
--------------------
AHHH, MY HAIR'S GONE!

AHHH!

...Oh, wait, never mind.
My extensions came off, that's all.
--------------------
Pet power
--------------------
Aww, that puppy was adorable!
I want a dog... How hip would that be,
me and my little poochie marching
down the street together?
--------------------
I've had it!
--------------------
Must not cry...must not cry...
Just wait, you JERKS!
'Cause I'm gonna quit your stupid company!

After I get my next bonus.
--------------------
Owwie
--------------------
Ooh, my neck is so stiff...
I feel sluggish, too. That's it<->next free day
I get, I'm heading to the hot springs to relax!

Wait, that's how my neck got sore in the
first place. I slept on it funny at the resort.
--------------------
Too crowded
--------------------
Yowza, where do they all COME from?
Don't these people have anywhere else
to go?

For that matter, don't I?
--------------------
Hard to walk
--------------------
Wait, nooo...
I don't want to go this way...ahh...

Let go of me, crowd!
Can't...control...direction...
--------------------
Starting point
--------------------
Standing here and figuring out where to go
is my favorite part of Shibuya.

It's like the whole town grew right out of
this intersection!
--------------------
Um, 'scuse me
--------------------
Everybody's in such a hurry...
No one stops long enough for me to
ask for directions!

Guess I'd better wait for a red light...
--------------------
Scramble
--------------------
Whoa! This place is, like, famous<->
this intersection is on TV all the time!
Wow, so cool!

Ooh, what if they're shooting a movie
here right now? Maybe I'll be in it!
--------------------
Hey...
--------------------
Ugh, this place is just too noisy!
I need to go somewhere with some
peace and quiet...

Wonder if there'd be less people over
by the station underpass.
--------------------
Scouts
--------------------
Guess the rumors were false.
Swarming with talent scouts?
Hmph. I've been here all week, and not
a single person has approached me.
--------------------
Shangri-La
--------------------
Finally, I made it: Shibuya, the glimmering
Emerald City in every country girl's eye!

Ooh ooh, 104 is right over there.
Big city shopping, here I come!
--------------------
Big screen
--------------------
How awesome would it be to sing
karaoke on that giant monitor?
--------------------
100% braver
--------------------
I am so glad I finally worked up enough
courage to go in Ten-Four!
The excitement still hasn't worn off!
--------------------
Oh, duh!
--------------------
It just clicked:
Ten-Four and 104 are the
same thing!
--------------------
Chillin'
--------------------
Just sitting and relaxing around here
chills me out more than anything.
Doesn't cost a yen, either.
--------------------
Survivor
--------------------
Urg, I feel like death warmed over...
I should've just stayed in bed.

Arg, no! I finally conned myself a date<->
I've gotta tough it out!
Drugstore, you're my only hope!
--------------------
Fascinating
--------------------
Here I am, at the perfect people-
watching spot.

One look, and you can almost kinda guess
what sort of life each of them leads.
--------------------
Exposure
--------------------
Wonder if there're shops with skimpier
clothes around...
I really wanna find out how much skin
I can get away with showing!
--------------------
Sparkle
--------------------
Sparkly clothing is, like, the hottest stuff
out there.
I'm totally gonna get a shimmery outfit and
then be the sparkliest girl in Shibuya!
--------------------
Wanna sit...
--------------------
Wish I could take a look at the stuff
I bought.

Isn't there a bench or something?
--------------------
Music
--------------------
Ooh, what's that song playing?
It really gets my blood pumping!

Bum-chicka, oomph, yeah!
Music just ain't music unless you can
dance to it!
--------------------
Storefronts
--------------------
I wanna buy that, and that, and that...
Too bad the only shopping my budget
allows is window shopping.
But the more I look, the more I want...
--------------------
Taste
--------------------
That arch sure is funny-looking.
I guess it's art?

Wonder how many people actually
stop to look at it...
--------------------
Foggy
--------------------
Was this the way to AMX?

Ehh, whatever, I'll get there eventually.
A little wandering now and then never
hurt anybody.
--------------------
Little touches
--------------------
Hey, these new banners rock pretty hard<->
'specially compared to the old ones.

Funny how little things like that change the
feel of the whole street.
--------------------
Mmm...
--------------------
I've got a date, but man, that
Korean barbecue smells so good!
Grilled garlic, mmm...

Guess I know where I'm takin' her!
--------------------
I love baseball
--------------------
If there's a Center Street, does that
mean there're Right and Left Streets too?
What about Pitcher Street or Catcher Road 
or First Base Boulevard or...
--------------------
Arcade
--------------------
Bored... Guess I'll go to the arcade! 
Where is it again? Oh, this way.
--------------------
TV debut
--------------------
I'm still in shock from that
"man on the street" TV interview
I did here the other day.

How come they made my
voice sound so funny?
--------------------
Everlasting
--------------------
Is it true taking photo stickers with your
boyfriend in the Center Street booths
will make your love last forever?

Better take some just in case!
--------------------
Smushed
--------------------
With people packed this tight,
their hopes and dreams must be all smushed
together, too...

Kind of exciting, when you think about it!
--------------------
Impossible
--------------------
My mission<->and I choose to accept it<->
is to hustle down this street as fast as
I can without touching anyone!
--------------------
Old habits?
--------------------
Geez, it's crowded...
If everybody's got a cell, how come they
all have to wait around here?

Guess you can't teach old dogs new tricks.
--------------------
Pooch
--------------------
If I died, I wonder if my Pooch would
come to the station and wait for me? 

...Yeah, he would.
He'd know my soul wasn't stuck at
some grave!
--------------------
I'm human!
--------------------
Just 'cause my name is Hachitaro
doesn't mean I want to be nicknamed
Hachi, like the dog! Grr...
--------------------
Dear Hachi!
--------------------
OK, before I get my lottery tickets,
I gotta say a prayer to Hachiko!
Urban legend or no, it's just not the
same if I don't!
--------------------
Marked
--------------------
Every time I go home, my dog pees on
my leg. What the hell do I look like,
a telephone pole?
--------------------
Crap!
--------------------
Seeing Hachiko reminded me<->
I forgot to feed the dog!
--------------------
If a dog can...
--------------------
Come on, I was one hour late!
That's no reason to leave without me...

Take a lesson from Hachiko,
would ya?
--------------------
Second look
--------------------
I never really took a hard look at
Hachiko before today.

I'm almost glad the guys have been
keeping me waiting this long; life's full
of eye-opening experiences.
--------------------
Jet-setting
--------------------
There's supposed to be some
sweet graff around here...

Wanna peep that ish, word is bond.
--------------------
Over there
--------------------
Isn't that Towa Records?
Whoa...

Pretty cool how the buildings you know
change depending on how you look at them.
Just like people!
--------------------
Relaxing
--------------------
So nice to be away from the crowds.
For Shibuya, this place is like an oasis!
--------------------
Here I am
--------------------
So, this is that park I always see 
from the train... 

Standing here sure puts things in perspective.
The train looks miserably crowded!
--------------------
Oh...
--------------------
I locked eyes with someone on the train...
Is it the touch of destiny?
--------------------
Can't wait!
--------------------
I gotta check out the court and
strategize for this Sunday's futsal game!
It's all about visualization!
--------------------
Train geek
--------------------
The F2311 series is so cool!
Woot, this is the perfect place for me
to watch it rush by!
--------------------
Familiar...
--------------------
Hey...
My favorite soap filmed a scene here!

I am sooo gonna reenact it!
--------------------
Trees
--------------------
Looking at trees makes me
want to give them a hug.
Wouldn't life be nice if we could hug
whatever we wanted whenever we wanted?
But it's never quite that easy...
--------------------
Vitality
--------------------
Ah, nature.
Even here in the heart of the city,
you flourish! You fight!
If the plants can overcome their
problems, so can I!
--------------------
Shortcut
--------------------
I can cut through here to get to work,
but I don't really enjoy it.

When it's rainy, it's gross and muddy,
and on clear days, it gets too buggy!
--------------------
Underpass
--------------------
Why is it always so creepy under the
railroad bridge?

Maybe 'cause it's so dark?
--------------------
Inspired
--------------------
Whoa... Drawings everywhere!
Actually, these are kinda cool.
Maybe I'll try doing some sketches
along these lines...
--------------------
Am I lost?
--------------------
Uhh...

How do I get to Cat Street again?
--------------------
River
--------------------
Wasn't there supposed to be a river
running beneath here?
--------------------
Poster
--------------------
Hmm... Hourly wage is 10,000 yen!?
Wow, that's a lot! And all I have to do is<->
WHOA WHOA, ARE YOU KIDDING!?

Nooo way! No amount of money's
worth my life!
--------------------
Pretty
--------------------
What a pretty picture!
Nothing better than a town overflowing
with art.
--------------------
Gotta wonder
--------------------
How did they paint that picture waaay
up there?

Guess they brought a ladder.
--------------------
Phone fortune
--------------------
Lessee, today's fortune...
Lucky color is black...
Places with roofs are lucky...
Hey, that could be here, right?
--------------------
Mood
--------------------
This wall really captures the
true feel of Shibuya.

Actually, I think it captures
the real me as well.
--------------------
Noise
--------------------
Car noise...train noise...
All the noise here makes the rest of the
world seem so far away...

But all the same, when have I ever
felt so close to myself?
--------------------
Yin and yang
--------------------
Funny... Only now, cut off from the
sky and walking through the dark, do I
really notice how bright it is out there.

I suppose that could be taken as
deep and meaningful.
--------------------
Miracles
--------------------
I walk by so many different people each day.
Which of them are meant to play a
part in my life? To change it?

If each and every encounter is a miracle,
then I'm lucky. My life is full of miracles.
--------------------
Break time
--------------------
Whew, it's about time for a break!
Wonder if there are any good cafés around
here. Nothin' beats a barista who really
knows joe.
--------------------
Unfair!
--------------------
It ain't right! If there's a Cat Street,
there oughta be a Dog Street, too!

Except...I bet it'd be a rough neighborhood.
Five minutes there and I'd have to
bounce.
--------------------
Saw it online
--------------------
Dammit, I trekked into the city to get
those rare sneakers I read about, and they
were already sold out!

Does all of Japan read the same board,
or what? Geez!
--------------------
Tin robot
--------------------
Man, something sure seemed familiar 
about that old toy at the used shop...

OH!

I used to have one until Ma threw it out!
--------------------
Breather
--------------------
Ooh, maybe I'll stop for tea while I'm here!
Though I guess I just had tea, like,
an hour ago...

Ah, never mind. My favorite place is
packed anyway.
--------------------
Which?
--------------------
Which store should I check out?
With all these trendy shops, it's hard to
settle on just one.

Guess I'll just have to go to them all{0120}{0154}
--------------------
Like home
--------------------
It's so calming here<->
everyone here seems so much like me!

Wish I could just live here...
--------------------
OMG
--------------------
Eee!
These earrings are sooo cute{0120}{0154}

Wait, my ears aren't pierced.
Poo.
--------------------
NO ENTRY
--------------------
Geez, why's it written so big?
--------------------
No space
--------------------
Boo, how am I supposed to get tea when
all the cafes are full? Guess I'll have to
get something from a machine.

Hope I can find one with those freaky
limited-time drinks...
--------------------
AMX
--------------------
Huh, there's an AMX here?
Maybe I'll check it out.
Oh, but I already bought CDs...

Bah, so what! Never ignore a record store.
Rule of the hipster, baby!
--------------------
Bad habit
--------------------
Whenever I come here, I get carried
away and buy a ton of CDs based just
on the covers.
But I don't have any place to put 'em!
I'm lucky the floor of my apartment doesn't
cave in...
--------------------
Dream
--------------------
Ugh, how can tripe like this be on the
racks when my song is so much better?

Guess it's just too sublime for the average
person to understand... The poor fools.
--------------------
Host club
--------------------
Any place that sells white shoes with
lamé trim for only 990 yen?
Gotta win over the ladies at work!
Heh heh heh...
--------------------
Bonuses
--------------------
Why do they have to give out so
many extras with first-edition CDs?
I don't have any place to put 'em,
but how can I throw away something
that's part of the package?
They're like a curse!
--------------------
Release day
--------------------
Today's the day all the new albums
come out!
Ooh, but those lines at the register...
It'll be hours before I can get home
and listen to them! Rrgh...
--------------------
Cheapskate
--------------------
Hmm, if I just used the listening
stations here at AMX, I'd, like, never
actually have to buy a CD.

But...wow, would I be lame...
--------------------
Played out
--------------------
The Prince is putting out another
"best of" disc? He doesn't even have
that many songs to begin with!
How're these the "best"?
--------------------
What to do?
--------------------
Guess I'll kill some time at the arcade.
Man, seems like I'm there all the time...
I keep on like this, I'll be considered a pro! 

A pro loser.
--------------------
Bunny
--------------------
Urrrg! I've pumped, what, 5,000 yen
into the machine?
How long till I WIN the damn thing!?
I can't back down in front of my baby.
Good thing I took my life savings out of
the bank this morning...
--------------------
That a robot?
--------------------
What a cool-looking police box!
Better stop staring, though, or they
might get the wrong idea...
--------------------
Preparations
--------------------
Hmm... Maybe I should pick up some
glasses at the place here, just for
show. The girls at the singles party
today aren't into the average joe,
from what I hear.
--------------------
BFE
--------------------
The crowds sure thin out when
you get this far from the station.
--------------------
Battery cover
--------------------
Ahh yeah, this is where we took
the sticker picture on my phone.

Man, were we young...
--------------------
Poor baby
--------------------
He's already spent 5,000 yen trying
to get that stuffed bunny out.
Bet it doesn't cost more than 500 yen
in stores, though...

My boy's adorable. Stupid, but adorable.
--------------------
Liar!
--------------------
NO WAY! The plushie he gave me for
my birthday was from a friggin' crane
game machine!
What a jerk! He couldn't even BUY
me a present!?
--------------------
Mobbed
--------------------
Blarg, this street is so narrow... 
There's barely room to get by.
Even the stores on the street are
cramped!
--------------------
Sweet scent
--------------------
Mmm...
This entire street smells like crepes...
Delicious!
--------------------
Crowded
--------------------
Narrow streets lined by narrow shops 
all crammed together... 
But I guess that's what gives this
place its charm.
--------------------
Signs
--------------------
Pretty neat...
You can see the big signs up close here.

Funny how different they seem when
you get up next to them like this.
More personal...
--------------------
Planner
--------------------
Huh, that Italian place looks pretty good.
Sweet, next date is set! 
Now, to plan our NEXT next date!
--------------------
Hungry
--------------------
Hot dogs, hot dogs... Found it!
Oh man, I am so late... Wonder if Saeko's 
still waiting for me.

Knowing her, she's prob'ly gonna grind
ME into a hot dog.
--------------------
Love it
--------------------
I really love how super-crowded this
place is. It seems so...Shibuya!
All the people and shops jammed
together get me psyched!
--------------------
Congested
--------------------
Wow, they don't waste a square
centimeter around here.
All these shops! Talk about sensory
overload...
--------------------
Rush
--------------------
Wonder why it's always such a rush to
shop here. Guess it's how everything's
jumbled together... 
It wouldn't be Spain Hill if it was all
neat 'n' tidy!
--------------------
Ooh, cute!
--------------------
This boutique carries just the most
adorable things! And they're all so cheap<->
free, practically!
--------------------
Dream meal
--------------------
Mmm, that divine, spicy spell!
Must...resist...pull...
If I keep pigging out on hot dogs
every time I pass by, I'm gonna gain
a ton of weight...
--------------------
Fine dining
--------------------
Next time I'm out here with my friend,
we should check out this Italian place.
--------------------
Dangerous
--------------------
I love shops like this<->
where you walk out hours after
you walk in, with no cash...
and no regrets.
--------------------
On a budget
--------------------
What should I pick up as prizes
for the big bingo tourney?
Something goofy... Nose glasses?
--------------------
Unexpected
--------------------
Geez, I went into Heads just to kill
some time. How'd I end up dropping
so much cash!?
There's, like, a demon in this place<->
a demon that makes you buy stuff!
--------------------
Hilly
--------------------
Can't believe people park on this hill... 
How do they start driving without 
hitting the guy behind them?
--------------------
House plant
--------------------
My cactus is getting awful large...
Maybe it's time to repot it. 
I'd better check at Shibu-Q Heads 
and see what they have.
--------------------
Here?
--------------------
This is the place where those three
guys in the indie band work?
--------------------
Hot item
--------------------
Wonder if they've still got any left...

They had plenty on the shelves last
week, but that was before they
showed it on TV...
--------------------
Pair
--------------------
Maybe I'll buy matching mugs 
for me and my sweetie{0120}{0154}
--------------------
No return
--------------------
Finally, I bought my costume! 
Now I am sooo gonna steal the show
at tomorrow's party.

Beware, mortals!
The goddess of laughter cometh!
--------------------
Movie
--------------------
Geh... Is the movie I picked out
for our date too obscure? No, no<->
everybody likes horror flicks, right?
Though I guess this one is kinda gory...
--------------------
Fired up!
--------------------
A Tin Pin slam-off?
Try a Tin Pin slaughter!
I've been hittin' the pins every day
and practicin', fools, so get ready
for an upset!
--------------------
Lost!
--------------------
Gah, where the hell am I?
I remember passing Molco on the
way out...but which Molco?

Who knew there was more
than one!?
--------------------
Out of luck
--------------------
Cripes, I forgot my cell!
Gotta find a public phone...
Ah, there we go.

Wait. Without my cell, I don't know 
anyone's number...
--------------------
Choices...
--------------------
Aw man, what a sweet jacket...
But I've only got another 5,000 yen 
to my name. If I buy it, I'll wind up
fashionably broke!
--------------------
Retail therapy
--------------------
So bored...
I know! I'll go shopping at Molco!
I'm sure that some cute new outfits
will lift my spirits!
--------------------
Boy next door
--------------------
That sweetie in the ads for the Gag is
TOTALLY my type, but no one ever
believes me!
Maybe it's 'cause I always hook up 
with roughnecks...
--------------------
Mimic
--------------------
The girls around here are so adorable... 
Maybe if I act like them, I can be cute,
too!
--------------------
Like-minded
--------------------
Dunno what it is, but something
about this place really gets my
creative juices flowing.
I feel like I'm in my element out here<->
like the other folks around really
get me.
--------------------
A++
--------------------
That is some bite-worthy
graff right there.
--------------------
Don't see it
--------------------
Where the heck is this shop?

Maybe it doesn't exist.
But the info was pretty specific to
just be a story...
--------------------
LP
--------------------
Sweet, found some rare records!
That warm, round sound.
These huge jackets!
CD's got nothin' on vinyl.
Just owning these makes my room
cooler by, like, a power of 18.
--------------------
Three
--------------------
LPs may be fragile, but the sound?
Luscious.
That's why I always buy three copies<->
one for listening, one for DJ'ing,
and one for holding onto.
--------------------
Flyers
--------------------
Wow, even flyers look pretty cool
when you throw 'em up in a pattern
like this.

Just goes to show how important it
is to mix things up now and then.
--------------------
Boring
--------------------
Hmm, for Shibuya, this area's
pretty plain...
Still, all kinds of people come to Shibuya,
so I guess this place must speak to
some of them.
--------------------
River
--------------------
The name of this place means
"Uda River"...

So...where's the river?
Ancient history?
--------------------
Multifaceted
--------------------
Wow, from the bustle of the main
streets to the peace and quiet out
here, Shibuya certainly is a town
of many faces!
--------------------
Present
--------------------
Augh, the girlfriend wants a
Pegaso watch for her birthday...
Geez, I haven't bought it yet, and my
wallet's already crying uncle!
--------------------
Future me
--------------------
When I was a kid, my parents
took me to this department store all
the time. Yeah... When I get older,
I wanna have a family just like that.
--------------------
On top
--------------------
I found my new hideout<->the roof here!
Man, I just love being up high and looking 
down over all of Shibuya. But it's awfully
crowded... Get your own hideout, punks!
--------------------
Clean?
--------------------
Bathroom, bathroom, gotta find a
bathroom!

I held it all the way here 'cause I don't
wanna go in some grody one...
--------------------
Women
--------------------
Whew! I agreed to go shopping
with her, but I didn't know we'd
be walking around all day!
I'm gonna pretend I'm lost and
take a break.
--------------------
Sweet tooth
--------------------
I should hit the shops down on the
basement floor and check out the sweets.
Walking around and snacking on the
cakes and candies down there rules!
--------------------
1,000 yen
--------------------
Aw, man... I can't find anything for
my baby's birthday...

Guess I'll have to up my budget.
--------------------
Discovery
--------------------
Ooh, they sell Pegaso?
Wonderful! I'll be doing my shopping
here from now on.
--------------------
Savings?
--------------------
Hey, I've finally saved up enough
store points to buy 100,000 yen worth
of stuff here!

Geez, how much does that mean 
I've spent!?
--------------------
Please win
--------------------
I only shop at department stores
during the super-cheap victory sales
after a pennant win.

Does that make me a tightwad?
--------------------
Round
--------------------
Man, he's late...
We were supposed to meet in front of
the round building, and... OH!
Ten-Four's round, too!
Arg, which one is right?
--------------------
Bad with maps
--------------------
Wait, where's Towa Records again?
I take a left at Cadoi, right?
I mean a right...left? Ahh!
Better go both ways to be sure.
--------------------
Present
--------------------
Pop's birthday's coming up...
What I should get him?
I'd better swing into Cadoi.
If I don't at least get him something small,
I can kiss my allowance goodbye!
--------------------
Clerk
--------------------
Aw, man... I did it again!
I bought the outfit the salesman
recommended!
And I swore to myself I'd pick out
my own clothes this time, ugh...
--------------------
Meeting up
--------------------
Standing around here is fascinating...
Watching folks meet up and talk<->
even just the expressions on their faces
tell amazing stories.
Who cares if I've been waiting for her
over an hour?
--------------------
What a deal!
--------------------
Ooh, I look awful today...
I really want to redo my makeup...

Ah! I know!
I'll go to Cadoi and get the girls at the
counter to make me over!
--------------------
Mind game
--------------------
Maybe I should get a Cadoi card... 
I can earn points with all my
purchases.
But, if I have a card, I'll be tempted to
buy more stuff since I'll be "saving"...
--------------------
Cadoi
--------------------
Cadoi has so many cute items.
I love this place!
If only they sold food<->I'd never need
to go anywhere else!
--------------------
New look
--------------------
Ugh, I'm so sick of how these
glasses look. Maybe I'll get a new pair
at Cadoi. Mmm, next time I want
red frames for sure!
--------------------
Which?
--------------------
Where to shop, Cadoi or Molco?
Hmm...

Whatever, I'll just go to both!
--------------------
Safety net
--------------------
This CD was sold out over at AMX.
Having two music shops in the
neighborhood is pretty convenient!
--------------------
Indies
--------------------
I think I'll check out the indies
selection over at Towa.

I'd rather be out discovering a hot
new act at one of the concert spaces
around, but this'll have to do.
--------------------
Two copies?
--------------------
So to get a ticket to the live show at
Towa Records, I have to buy the CD
there?
But I already bought it at AMX...
Aww, hell. I really wanna see the show,
so I guess I'll pick up another one.
--------------------
Quick listen
--------------------
All right, I've got a minute.
I'll pop into Towa and listen to the
new albums.

Though, every time I do, I end up
buying something...
--------------------
Originality
--------------------
This building is just so cool!
I would love to own a loft in a building
like this!

Now, live in it? That's another story.
--------------------
Hmm...
--------------------
Wonder if there're any concerts tonight?
There's just something about music 
performed live that makes it extra special.
--------------------
Naturally
--------------------
This week's number one song...
Of course it's gonna be the Prince!
--------------------
No shame
--------------------
I wanted to buy that song that's in
those commercials, but for the life of me,
I can't remember the title.

At this rate, I'll have to sing it
for the clerk...
--------------------
Bus bus bus
--------------------
Buses everywhere!
Which one am I supposed to ride?

Ehh, guess I'll just get on one
and take my chances.
--------------------
Moyai
--------------------
Ahh, so that's the Moyai statue. 
Wonder if it's got a story behind it like
Hachiko does... I'll have to check it out.
It probably has some connection
to the Moai.
--------------------
Just do it?
--------------------
Uhh, is this the way to Pork City?
Who knows...

Guess I'll just have to try it<->
fingers crossed!
--------------------
Heart attack
--------------------
AHH!
Geez! I swear that statue just moved!
The heck is wrong with me?
I've been gaming too hard...
--------------------
Huh?
--------------------
Come on, not this place again...

The roads here are so confusing,
I can't find where I'm trying to go...
--------------------
Forgot my card
--------------------
What's the bus fare to Shinjuku
from here?

It's probably faster to take the train...
--------------------
Not again
--------------------
I don't see my bus anywhere...
Is it at the East Exit?
--------------------
Bus pass
--------------------
OK, bus time.
Lemme find some change...

Ack, I've only got large bills!
Enough<->after this I'm sucking it up
and getting a bus pass.
--------------------
Gag!
--------------------
Whoa, anybody heard of
emissions standards around here?
But I guess pollution is just
one of the flavors of Shibuya...
--------------------
Gas?
--------------------
Ugh, what's that smell?
Is this what the big city's s'posed 
to smell like?
Sure is different from home...
--------------------
Mirage
--------------------
For a minute there,
I swear I saw a river up ahead.
Must be going crazy...
--------------------
Battle
--------------------
The graff around here ain't half bad.
Can't compare to mine, though!
Think I'll come by later and 
show 'em how tags are done!
--------------------
Am I weird?
--------------------
I prefer murky places like this.

We creatures of the night relish
the darkness, mwa ha ha!
--------------------
Fight
--------------------
This area reminds me of one of those
arenas, where night after night
gangs fight over their turf.

Or maybe I should cut down on the TV.
--------------------
Spooky
--------------------
What a spooky place to walk through
alone... But eek, it'd be worse if
somebody else was here...sneaking up
behind me... Brr!
Gotta stop imagining things!
--------------------
Confused
--------------------
Is this not the way to the East Exit
Bus Terminal? Where the heck is it?
Did it fall off the face of the earth?

...Did I!?
--------------------
Black
--------------------
Whoa... Everything around here is
black from all the dirt and smog.

Kinda gross to think we're breathing
this in.
--------------------
Hold up...
--------------------
The bikes parked here had to come from
somewhere, right?
But they sure don't look like they've
been touched anytime recently...
--------------------
Gluttony
--------------------
Life is short.
Gotta do as many enjoyable things
as I can...like ramen-hopping!
--------------------
A, B, or C?
--------------------
Should I see a movie? Go to karaoke? 
Or just eat ramen? I can't decide...
so I'll do 'em all!
--------------------
My way
--------------------
A real beef bowl's gotta be super juicy
and topped with egg!
Maybe eating that way'll get me fat,
but hey, if the food is good,
it's worth it!
--------------------
Dogen
--------------------
I know it's a hill, but the name really
sounds like some old shogun or something...
Definitely someone with a beard<->
a real bushy one, too.
--------------------
Restrained
--------------------
Whoa, this is so much more low-key
than by the station!
I can hardly believe this is the same
Shibuya.
--------------------
Watchers
--------------------
Something about the buildings
around here is so melancholy...

You can tell the street has watched
countless lives and dreams
come and go.
--------------------
Triple-header
--------------------
This where the next singles party is?
Three in one day is pretty rough,
but I can't help it<->it's so much fun!
--------------------
Memories
--------------------
Oh... I broke up with my boyfriend 
at this movie theater.

...Toshi? Akio? 
Which one was it?
--------------------
Jaywalk?
--------------------
Augh, Pork City is right there<->
why can't I cross the street!?
There should be a crosswalk!

So close, and yet so far...
--------------------
Restaurant
--------------------
Sure are a lot of places to eat
around here. How am I supposed
to choose? 
Guess I'll follow my nose... 
And it says today's lunch is ramen!
--------------------
Coupons
--------------------
Hmm, where should we have the
singles party? Definitely should be a
place I've got a coupon for...
Good thing I check the circulars.
I know all the best places, and save
money in the process!
--------------------
Eureka!
--------------------
If there are bars for billiards and darts,
why not bars for mahjong, too?

I can't believe no one's thought of this.
It's a goldmine!
--------------------
Paradise
--------------------
This place is always full of pretty young
things, waiting to catch a glimpse of the
performers as they leave.

Me, I just like to watch THEM...
Hurr hurr hurr.
--------------------
In the way
--------------------
A-East is roomy enough, but half the
time you'll be stuck behind a column or
something. If those things weren't
in the way, you could see real good...
Sucks.
--------------------
Masked
--------------------
Our band is super-popular,
but when I take off my makeup,
I look like your average schlub.
If no one's gonna notice I'm a star,
then what's the point?
Maybe the makeup needs to go.
--------------------
Best of luck...
--------------------
My favorite band has finally made it big.
I'm happy for them, but it's still kinda
sad that I won't be able to hear them here
anymore. And if they end up selling out to
the man, I'll never forgive 'em!
--------------------
Wrong!
--------------------
Geh, I had the wrong date for
the band I wanted to see!
I waited so long to see them live,
and their show was yesterday!
--------------------
Just once
--------------------
If I wait here, I bet I'll get to talk to
Def M{0191}rch's vocalist, 777! This time,
I'll definitely wring a smile out of him!
--------------------
Back streets
--------------------
It might be dark and cramped
around here, but for us music lovers,
it's home<->the highway of kings!
--------------------
Single screen
--------------------
Maybe I'll check out a movie at Shibukyu.
They always show films you can't see
anywhere else.
--------------------
Manga!
--------------------
I can never get over how big the
bookstore here is! And they keep it nice
and cool, so I can escape the heat
and dive into some great stories.
The place was made for me!
--------------------
Classy
--------------------
I like it here.
The roads narrow out, and the
crowds THIN out.
Perfect, peace and quiet!
--------------------
Privilege
--------------------
When I was younger, I thought that
only adults were allowed to shop at
department stores. That's why I was
always in such a hurry to grow up!
--------------------
Cheap!
--------------------
Urg, I'm out of shampoo again...
I've gotta find some, and cheap.
Wonder if there's a drugstore around...
--------------------
Starts soon
--------------------
Hmm... Today's show is at the
place on the corner?
The shows there are always staged so
well, and who can say no to fantasy?
But, they've gotten so popular,
tickets sell out quick...
--------------------
Sale!
--------------------
Hey, Dragon Couture is having a big sale!
But their regular prices are so high,
I still can't afford anything...
--------------------
Window
--------------------
Window shopping at Shibukyu always
gets me excited!
Someday, I'm going to own awesome
stuff like that!
--------------------
No rain
--------------------
The weather report was wrong again!
When am I gonna get a chance to use my
new umbrella?

I know! I'll use it as a parasol!
--------------------
Free food
--------------------
Pretty sure Rikako works around here...
Hmm, I am kinda hungry. Maybe I'll pop in
and say hi.

She might even sneak me some free fries!
--------------------
Late!
--------------------
Crap, late to my first date!
I thought if I gamed through the night
I wouldn't oversleep. But then that GAME<->
I couldn't tear myself away... Dammit!
Aw, screw the date. I wanna go play s'more.
--------------------
Tokyo
--------------------
Hoo-wee, the big city sure can spook a feller.
It's like everybody's gimmin' me the evil eye.
Do I look that outer place? Is it my clothes?
It's my clothes, ain't it?
--------------------
Love plan
--------------------
Where is this phone booth people keep
talking about?

If I use it to ask her out, she's 100% guaranteed
to say yes, right? Gotta find that phone!
--------------------
Chicks
--------------------
If I were taller, girls would think I was so hot...
But I stopped growing years ago.
Maybe I'll get an afro instead!
--------------------
Miss U
--------------------
Wonder which drugstore has that
super-hot pharmacist...
If she won her university's beauty contest,
she must be bangin'!
--------------------
Party
--------------------
I wanna put together a party, but who should
I get to DJ?

Hmm, the Yosh-man over at Cyco Records DJs
from time to time, right? Maybe I'll ask him.
--------------------
Space cadet
--------------------
Seems like it'd be real hard to
get with the girl who wrote that blog
I read yesterday...

I mean, what the hell is
"princess training"?
--------------------
Tenth job
--------------------
Aw, geez, fired again...
What am I doing wrong?
I smile at customers and everything...
--------------------
Hopeless?
--------------------
Ten days on this stakeout...
The suspect's a blonde with dark skin and
gaudy makeup. But there's so many kids
like that around here, I can't tell 'em apart!
--------------------
Soccer
--------------------
About time we found a team to play against!
Masuoka had better show this time,
or we're doomed.

Why's he suddenly so interested in other
sports?
--------------------
Chameleon
--------------------
After seeing that croc at Shinta's place,
I really want a pet...

Maybe a chameleon? Wonder how you even
take care of 'em... Better ask Shinta.
--------------------
Tired
--------------------
I'm so tired of plain old hamburgers.
If only there were gourmet burgers...
Like, a caviar burger, or a foie gras burger...
or a truffle burger!
--------------------
Bad idea
--------------------
Ugh, these new shoes!
My heels are killing me...
The fronts are really long, so I bought a size
smaller than usual. Urg, bad idea.
--------------------
Cosplay
--------------------
Last week's episode of "Slammurai" was
so kickass. I still can't believe the main
character lost!
I always knew the rival dude was cooler.
If I dressed up as any character,
it would so be him.
--------------------
Special treat
--------------------
Urrrg. So hungry...
Guess it's 100-yen insta-noodles again.
Just once I'd like to try the 300-yen kind.

But I don't have 300 yen, so I'll just eat three
of the 100-yen ones I've got at home!
--------------------
Free and easy
--------------------
Ehh, whatever.
Why do today what can wait till tomorrow?
Why do tomorrow what I can deal with
two days from now?

My problem-free life rocks so hard.
--------------------
Souvenir
--------------------
Blarg, forgot the souvenir I got for Frank
the exchange student.
Guess I'll have to buy another...

What a waste. What the heck am I gonna
do with a samurai wig?
--------------------
Five hours
--------------------
Hmm, I'm here way early...
Well, that beats being late, right?
Nothing wrong with being a trailblazer. Just think!
I'm living the future RIGHT NOW.
--------------------
Follower
--------------------
Does that guy from class really know CAT?
Ahh, I am so jealous! How do I get him to
introduce me?

Seriously, if he can get me in with CAT,
I'll follow him to the ends of the earth!
--------------------
No energy...
--------------------
I'm so tired, I have, like, negative energy...
I hear red viper and ginseng can really help,
but what kind of drink has that stuff in it?
--------------------
Dr. Fumiko
--------------------
Ooh, those glasses, that lab coat... HAWT.
I can't go a single day without dropping into
Nishimura Drugs just to gaze at her.
--------------------
Catalyst
--------------------
CAT's new commercial will be airing soon...
I can't wait! No one knows how to floor me
with their ideas (or put a smile on my face!)
like CAT.
--------------------
Kyo
--------------------
Wonder if Kyo will be boarding at the park
today...

I gotta get out there and see his tricks in
person sometime.
--------------------
War of flyers
--------------------
The Towa Records and AMX guys both write
some passionate reviews in those store flyers<->
too passionate. They're way off base!
--------------------
Parched
--------------------
So thirsty...
And all the drink machines are out of change,
so they won't take my bills.

Dammit! All this over ten yen!
--------------------
Secondhand
--------------------
"Recycle shops"?
What the hell is that all about?
Take a bunch of trash and try and dump it
on other people? The nerve of it!
--------------------
Delish
--------------------
Why don't they put bean paste on pancakes
hee'ah?

I can't wait to get back home to Nagoya
whay'ah they know how to make 'em right.
--------------------
Stubborn
--------------------
Urg, my stomach...
I need some of that Chinese herbal stuff.
There's a good place around here, but I hear
the guy who runs it is a pain in the ass.
What if he won't sell to me?
--------------------
Revelation
--------------------
Sometimes when you're thinking really hard
about a problem, the answer just pops into
your head.

Wish that happened more often...
--------------------
Offbeat
--------------------
CAT's commercials totally throw convention
 to the wind. The ideas are so fresh!
If only I could make such groundbreaking
films...
--------------------
RL MTG
--------------------
They'll be here any minute!
Wonder what they all look like...

This is gonna be so rad. A Slammurai costume
party with all my best online slamigos! LOL
--------------------
Enough!
--------------------
I've only been in Shibuya for a week,
and already I've had it! Why don't they sell
Hiroshima-yaki here?

If I don't eat it at least once a day,
life has no meaning!
--------------------
777
--------------------
I am so looking forward to 777's gig!
Maybe I'll mosh today...

Mmm, he's so shadowy, so mysterious!
I swear, he has to be the hottest man alive.
--------------------
Fortune
--------------------
They say cleaning the toilet makes you lucky
with money. OK, look out, world!
Soon as I get home, I'm grabbing that toilet
brush and scrubbing!
--------------------
Mentality
--------------------
Whew, I'm beat.
I want to sit down and have some tea<->
but nah, that's a waste.
Better I save the money than drink it away!
--------------------
Grandfather
--------------------
I know Grandfather's store is around here
somewhere, but the streets are so crowded...
Really, does he have to slog through this
rabble every single day?
--------------------
Perfect mate
--------------------
If I have to marry, then CAT's definitely the one.
That uncompromising style, those brilliant ideas!
Now I just have to hope he's actually a man.
--------------------
Stage
--------------------
Yumi's stage debut is coming up.
How dedicated is that, to attend rehearsals
even while part-timing?
She always manages to steal the show.
--------------------
Need sleep
--------------------
If I go to the beauty salon now,
I'll fall asleep while they're shampooing me.

Shame I can't go...
That stylist is a total hunk.
--------------------
Perfume
--------------------
I'm gonna try making my own scent:
the smell of cute! People will love it!
--------------------
Concert
--------------------
That trio from Shibu-Q Heads is playing today.
I like their sound, but it's the funny between-
song banter that does it for me.

Hmm, what was the band's name again?
--------------------
Blog
--------------------
Wonder if the Prince has posted anything new
on his blog.
Checking it every day is what I live for!
--------------------
Game show
--------------------
The Shibuya Game Show last month was
such a blast!
And those uniforms the floor staff had on
were super-cute. Ooh, I want one...
--------------------
No salt!
--------------------
Hmm, I could use a snack.
Good thing I picked up those fries.

...Oh, no! I left my can of salt at home!
What are fries without that extra layer of
white, salty death?
--------------------
Smells good
--------------------
Ooh, that person who just walked by
smells great. Wonder what scent...

I should ask so I can pick some up,
but talk about awkward!
"Excuse me, I was just smelling you..."
--------------------
Hat
--------------------
Some people really know how to work the
hat look. I should pick one up so I can be
more like them.
--------------------
The real CAT
--------------------
So then, CAT was a group of twenty
different creators?

Makes sense. CAT covers so many genres,
and releases new work all the time.
One person could never be that prolific.
--------------------
Deadline
--------------------
I have to turn that draft in soon...
But I don't want to face it,
so I'm out here instead...
--------------------
Singer?
--------------------
Ohh, my throat!

It's all that karaoke.
Guess I overdid it with a week straight of
eight-hour solo sessions...
--------------------
New single
--------------------
The Prince's new song is the best ever!
He barely stays on key, but that's what
makes it so mesmerizing.
I can't get it out of my head!
--------------------
It's the smell
--------------------
Whenever I go by Cat Street, I get the urge
for a cup of coffee.
But the café there is always closed!
--------------------
Weebers!
--------------------
Uhh, I'm not good with crowds...
Crowds bring out those symbols<->the weebers!
I can see them everywhere!

There! Clinging to that guy's back<->
WEEBERS!!! Weebie weebie weebie...
--------------------
Decision
--------------------
Arg, I can't take it anymore!
I'm gonna find that man and confess to him
right now!
--------------------
Rentals
--------------------
CD rentals are all half-price now.
Now's my chance to rent everything
I wanted to listen to!

I was smart to hold off.
--------------------
Impact
--------------------
I'm so tired of looking "normal."
I should pick up something really out there<->
maybe an accessory?

I know! What about a book bag?
--------------------
Unbearable
--------------------
I put my eyeliner on thicker today to hide
the lines under my eyes, and everyone said
I looked cute, like a panda!

That doesn't make me feel any better.
--------------------
New phone
--------------------
I really want a new cell phone.
I'm definitely springing for that CAT design
if I get one. The thing is round!
It hardly looks like a phone.

Unless...it's not?
--------------------
Missionary
--------------------
Today, I'm gonna make 100 people happy.
What goes around, comes around!
--------------------
Annoying!
--------------------
Arg!
Why do the salespeople have to bug me?
If you want me to buy something,
then shut up so I can actually look at stuff!
--------------------
I'm getting...
--------------------
Goosebumps!
What's all this bad energy I'm picking up?
It's like something else is here.
Something...not human...
--------------------
Can't go home
--------------------
Ohh, why does my place have to have
roaches? They're so creepy!
Can't someone get rid of them for me?
Wonder if Dad'll do me this one favor...
--------------------
Stupid!
--------------------
Darn, today's the first episode
of that new soap starring the Prince,
and I didn't set my VCR!

I'll just have to stand in the electronics
store and watch.
--------------------
Superfad
--------------------
I tied on a misanga bracelet because they
were really in...three years ago.
When is this damn thing gonna fall off?
I want my wish to come true!
--------------------
Box set
--------------------
That hot new game will be out soon!
I'm sooo getting in line for the limited edition.
Heck, just lining up with everyone is like
a big party!
--------------------
Rain dance
--------------------
Come on, rain clouds! Grrr...
I can't watch my soap unless the
game is cancelled.

Stupid baseball, trying to knock the Prince
out of his rightful time slot!
--------------------
Just like that
--------------------
Huh?

No waaay!
Where'd the shop that was here go?
The stores here change way too fast...
--------------------
Bad girl
--------------------
"Don't get any thinner," he said.
Well, I don't want to let my honeybear down...
so from now on, it's three full meals a day
and snacks every two hours!
--------------------
