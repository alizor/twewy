<red>Touch the pin<black> at the
lower right of the bottom
screen to try out its
<red>scanning<black> ability.
--------------------
You can end the scan and
return to the normal field
screen by touching the
same pin again.
--------------------
Neku has to wear pins or
he <red>won't be able to attack<black>
foes in battle!
--------------------
<red>Touch the phone icon<black> in
the upper-right corner of
the bottom screen to
open the Phone Menu.
--------------------
From there, go to the
<red>Pins Menu<black> to choose pins
for Neku to wear.
Give it a try!
--------------------
From here on out,
allowing Neku and his
partner's <red>HP<black> to reach
zero will spell <red>Game Over<black>!
--------------------
Now would be a good time
to use the <red>Save Menu<black> on
your phone.
--------------------
If you save your
progress, you'll be able to
<red>resume the game from
that point<black> even if you quit
or get a Game Over.
--------------------
You can purchase items
from the Shop Menu using
<red>money ($)<black>.
--------------------
See something you want?
Just <red>drag an item to the
shopping cart<black> to buy it!
--------------------
If you run low on money,
get more by <red>selling<black>
(discarding) pins you
don't need.
--------------------
Open the <red>Pins Menu<black>,
then <red>drag unwanted pins
into the trash can<black> to cash
them in.
--------------------
Neku and his partner can
eat <red>food items<black> to boost
their sync rate or raise
other stats.
--------------------
Use the <red>Items Menu<black> to eat
food. Every food item
takes a certain number of
"bytes" to digest.
--------------------
<red>Fighting battles after
eating<black> burns bytes.
Fully digest the food for
an Attack, Defense, or
other <red>stat bonus<black>.
--------------------
Think carefully about
what to eat! Characters
can only digest <red>24 bytes
per day in real time<black>.
--------------------
Once the <red>date changes<black>,
this number will reset and
they will be ready to eat
<red>another 24 bytes<black>.
--------------------
You can imprint <red>memes<black>
directly into people's
minds during <red>imprinting
sequences<black>.
--------------------
When the <red>Player Pin<black>
appears over a person's
heart, that's your chance!
<red>Touch the pin.<black>
--------------------
A scanning field will open
and you will start reading
the person's thoughts.
<red>Touch the Player Pin
again<black> to select a meme.
--------------------
The meme you imprint will
<red>affect the person's
actions<black>. Be creative!
--------------------
Buy items at a shop to fill
the <red>friendship gauge
(FSG)<black> and befriend the
clerk.
--------------------
Get to know a clerk well
enough and they will share
<red>info about item abilities<black>,
or offer <red>new items for
sale<black>.
--------------------
Store items marked with
the word <red>QUEST<black> can't be
bought with money.
--------------------
To obtain a <red>quest item<black>,
you'll need to <red>gather the
materials<black> listed on the
QUEST info tab.
--------------------
If one of the required
materials is a pin, you'll
need to <red>master the pin<black>
before the clerk will
accept it.
--------------------
Each area of Shibuya has
a <red>brand chart<black> that ranks
brands according to <red>local
trends<black>.
--------------------
A brand's rank on this
chart may <red>raise or lower
the Attack<black> of all its pins
during combat.
--------------------
The top-ranked brand
gets a <red>massive Attack
boost<black>, while the bottom
brand's <red>Attack is halved<black>.
--------------------
You can check the local
chart from your <red>phone<black>.
Keep your finger on
Shibuya's fashion pulse!
--------------------
You can <red>influence the
local brand chart<black> by
wearing threads and pins
from your <red>favorite brand<black>
into battle.
--------------------
Changing the rankings
will <red>affect the area and
the people in it<black>.
--------------------
<red>Bend the trends<black> to your
will and create a Shibuya
that's <red>yours alone<black>!
--------------------
Looking to score pins and
a ton of PP? Try taking
on a group of enemies at
once in a <red>chain battle<black>.
--------------------
<red>Touch more than one
Noise Symbol<black> before the
battle starts, then get
ready to reduce some
Noise!
--------------------
With each round, or
"reduction," the <red>Noise get
tougher<black><->but they also
<red>drop more pins<black>!
--------------------

--------------------
The same enemy may
drop different pins in
battle depending on your
difficulty setting.
Check the <red>Noise Report<black>!
--------------------
Still feel like you aren't
getting those pin drops?
Try living dangerously with
the <red>level change system<black>!
--------------------
Open your <red>phone<black> and
<red>adjust the yellow level
gauge (LVG)<black> on the
bottom screen to set
your level <red>lower<black>.
--------------------
The lower you go, the
<red>fewer HP<black> you'll have, but
the <red>rate at which enemies
drop pins will skyrocket<black>!
--------------------

--------------------
Items that start with <red>(S)<black>
and depict characters
from the story are special
treasures called <red>stickers<black>.
--------------------
<red>Once you own a sticker<black>,
it will grant you the <red>special
ability<black> described on its info
tab.
--------------------
For example, owning
  <red>"(S) Extra Slot"<black>
allows Neku to wear <red>one
additional pin<black>!
--------------------
Pick up stickers as you
progress in the game, or
buy them at shops.
If you see one, <red>grab it<black>!
--------------------
Shiki will <red>jump<black> if you press
up on the +Control Pad
(or the X Button).
She can even <red>attack in
midair<black>!
--------------------
In fact, her combo
finishers deal <red>twice as
much damage from the air<black>
as they do from the
ground.
--------------------
To attack in midair,
just press left or right on
the +Control Pad
(or the A or Y Buttons)
while jumping.
--------------------
While Shiki is performing a
combo, she can wheel
around and deliver a blow
to foes behind her.
This is called a <red>counter<black>.
--------------------
Land a counter and she
will deal <red>massive damage<black>!
--------------------
It's simple to pull off.
Just press the button for
the <red>direction opposite the
way Shiki is attacking<black>.
--------------------
So if she's attacking left,
press right on the
+Control Pad
(or the A Button). Try it!
--------------------
The enigmatic Joshua
fights differently than
your previous partner,
Shiki.
--------------------
As you progress through
the combo map, he'll <red>lock
on<black> to more and more
enemies.
--------------------
When you reach the
combo finisher, he'll deal
damage to <red>all targeted
foes at once<black>.
--------------------
If <red>only one enemy is
present<black>, he can lock on
to it multiple times to
deliver <red>massive damage<black>!
--------------------
Joshua is a prickly
partner for a laundry list
of reasons...just one
being that he <red>can't jump<black>.
--------------------
He'll have to dodge enemy
attacks instead!
--------------------
To <red>sidestep<black>, press
down on the +Control Pad
(or the B Button) while
Joshua is stationary.
--------------------
Keep an eye on
approaching enemies and
gracefully dodge their
blows. Then <red>strike back<black>!
--------------------
While performing a combo,
Joshua can use his
phone's <red>camera<black> to shift
enemies left or right
across the screen.
--------------------
Just press the button for
the <red>direction opposite the
way Joshua is attacking<black>.
--------------------
So if he's attacking left,
press right on the
+Control Pad
(or the A Button).
--------------------
Shift enemies to one side
to <red>stun them<black>.
Once they're clumped
together, smite them with
a quick combo!
--------------------
Joshua will <red>teleport into
the air<black> if you press up on
the +Control Pad
(or the X Button).
--------------------
From there he can <red>wail on
foes beneath him<black>.
His aerial attacks <red>deal
damage with each step<black>
through the combo map.
--------------------
<red>Lock on to enough
enemies<black> and you can
<red>transform his finisher<black> into
an increasingly powerful
attack.
--------------------
When aloft, Joshua is
<red>significantly<black> stronger.
Use that power to your
advantage!
--------------------
Beat is a regular acrobat
on his board. He can <red>jump<black>
right from the outset!
--------------------
Just remember that his
<red>ground combo finisher is
stronger<black>.
--------------------
Though his <red>aerial attacks<black>
do less damage, they also
<red>hit enemies both in the air
and on the ground<black>.
--------------------
Jump to avoid enemy
attacks, then <red>return the
hurt in spades<black>. It's death
from above, baby!
--------------------
Beat can jump while in the
middle of performing a
combo. This is called an
<red>air cancel<black>.
--------------------
Just press the button for
the <red>direction opposite the
way Beat is attacking<black>.
--------------------
So if he's attacking left,
press right on the
+Control Pad
(or the A Button).
--------------------
Air cancel mid-combo to
avoid danger, then <red>switch
to an aerial combo<black> and
keep delivering the hurt!
--------------------
