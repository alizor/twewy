<red>This is a TEMP event!
To be finished later.<black>
--------------------
What the...
--------------------
I can hear voices
in my head!
--------------------
What just
happened?
--------------------
And where'd this
pin come from?
--------------------
Hmm...
--------------------
Wonder if there's
a connection...
--------------------
Voices!
Definitely voices!
--------------------
But why?
--------------------
Am I
hearing people's
thoughts!?
--------------------
What the hell
IS this pin?
--------------------
Huh?
Whose phone?
--------------------
Mine?
--------------------
"Reach 104.
You have 60 minutes.
--------------------
"Fail, and face erasure.
<->The Reapers"
--------------------
Oh, that's cute.
--------------------
See ya, spam.
Deleted.
--------------------
Huh?
--------------------
Still there...
--------------------
It's like the junk
mail from hell.
--------------------
Oww!
My hand...
--------------------
F...frogs!?
--------------------
Oww!
What the...
--------------------
They attacked me!
--------------------
What do they
want with me?
--------------------
D-down, froggie...
--------------------
...Ungh!
--------------------
What the hell
is going on!?
--------------------
Somebody!
Help!
--------------------
Hey...
Everybody stop
ignoring me!
--------------------
What is
this place...
--------------------
Crap!
--------------------
I gotta run!
--------------------
Man, here we
go again...
--------------------
Stop whining.
We haven't had work
in, like, forever.
--------------------
Exactly.
It feels like the
Monday after
vacation.
--------------------
You'd prefer
a permanent
vacation?
--------------------
Day 1 has the
most Players.
Now's our chance
to rack up some
points!
--------------------
How else you
gonna make up
for last month?
--------------------
Aight, aight...
One week won't kill
me. Probably.
--------------------
Hey, while
we're at it...
--------------------
How 'bout we
play a little game?
--------------------
A gaaame?
--------------------
Yeah, so it
doesn't feel so
much like work.
C'mon, you love it.
--------------------
Oh, yeah.
You know me.
--------------------
Sigh...
All right.
--------------------
What's the
game?
--------------------
How 'bout
Reaper Sport 3,
a Player Hunt?
--------------------
Let's see who
bags the most
Players during
today's mission.
--------------------
Are you joking?
That's no fun
at all!
--------------------
You don't
like it?
--------------------
But I'm gonna
crush you! There's
no contest!
--------------------
Ohh, zing!
--------------------
Now I have
to actually try.
--------------------
You know the drill.
Loser buys winner a
hot bowl of ramen.
--------------------
Huff, huff...
--------------------
Should be...
safe...here...
--------------------
Rrgh...
Freakin' frogs!
--------------------
Just leave
me alone!
--------------------
I didn't do
anything to you!
--------------------
They vanished!
Why are people
disappearing!?
--------------------
What's
happening...
--------------------
Why am I
even here?
What the hell!
--------------------
They're gonna
get me...
--------------------
Found one!
--------------------
Huh?
--------------------
You!
Forge a <red>pact<black>
with me!
--------------------
Uhh... I've kinda
got my hands full...
--------------------
Listen!
If we forge a
pact, we can
beat the <red>Noise<black>!
--------------------
Who cares
about a little
noise?
--------------------
You wanna be
erased? Hurry up!
There's no time!
--------------------
Make a pact
with me! Please!
--------------------
A-all right!
--------------------
I accept.
--------------------
What's with
the light show?
--------------------
Here!
--------------------
Use this <red>pin<black>!
--------------------
But...the
funny lights...
--------------------
I'll explain later!
--------------------
Right now we
have to stop the
Noise!
--------------------
Uhh...
OK?
--------------------
Get ready!
--------------------
That fire...
--------------------
I did that!?
--------------------
Whoa!
You can use
the pin?
--------------------
You must be
really good at
<red>psychs<black>.
--------------------
Guess I found
the right partner,
huh?
--------------------
That's what you
call those flames?
A psych?
--------------------
Yup.
--------------------
And now that
we've made a pact,
the Noise won't
come after us!
--------------------
In other words,
we're safe.
--------------------
Right.
See? All gone.
--------------------
All gone.
--------------------
So...what are
Noise?
--------------------
They're those
monsters we just
fought. Duh.
--------------------
Monsters?
Uh, sure...
--------------------
And "psychs"?
--------------------
Is that what
this pin is for?
--------------------
Anyway, where
are my manners?
--------------------
My name's
Shiki Misaki.
--------------------
Call me
Shiki.
--------------------
I call this
wack.
--------------------
We've got a
long week ahead
of us!
--------------------
A week?
Week of what?
--------------------
The <red>Reapers'
Game<black> is seven days
long, right?
--------------------
Reapers?
Excuse me?
--------------------
Who is this flake?
--------------------
So what's
your name?
--------------------
Forget her...
Where am I? How
did I get here?
--------------------
C'mon, tell me
your name.
--------------------
The sign says
"Shibuya Station"...
--------------------
Why am I
in Shibuya?
--------------------
Something
wrong?
--------------------
Wait...
The intersection.
--------------------
I just need to
retrace my steps.
--------------------
Hey, whoa...
Wait for me!!!
--------------------
Why are you
following me!?
--------------------
Why are you
making yourself so
hard to follow?
--------------------
Screw you.
I go where
I want.
--------------------
Go where?
--------------------
We're trapped
in here!
--------------------
What?
Don't be
stupid.
--------------------
You're the one
being stupid.
--------------------
We made a pact.
We're supposed to
stick together!
--------------------
You can't beat
the Noise alone.
--------------------
You can't
survive!
--------------------
Survive what?
--------------------
The Game!
Don't you wanna
win?
--------------------
Pfft.
Play games on
your own time.
--------------------
Hey!
That's not
funny!
--------------------
They'll erase us
if we don't win!
--------------------
You saw what
happened to
those people!
--------------------
You wanna
join them?
--------------------
Besides, we're
partners.
--------------------
Partners
work together.
--------------------
No way!
Don't make me
a part of this.
--------------------
You're already
a part of this.
--------------------
You're a <red>Player<black>,
just like me.
--------------------
A what?
--------------------
I'm not
playing anything.
--------------------
Oh yeah?
--------------------
Then why do
you have a
Player Pin?
--------------------
Don't you have
a timer on your
hand? I do...
--------------------
What. The.
Hell.
--------------------
See, you're part
of the Reapers'
Game, too.
--------------------
......
--------------------
We don't have
time for this!
--------------------
The clock's
ticking! We've only
got 20 minutes!
--------------------
Let's hurry
to Ten-Four!
--------------------
"Ten-Four"?
--------------------
What's
that?
--------------------
Ten-Four!
104?
--------------------
You got the
mail, right?
--------------------
"Reach 104 or
face erasure."
--------------------
That junk
mail...
--------------------
Please.
--------------------
What kind
of nut would
believe that?
--------------------
Then again...
--------------------
This day
has been pretty
weird.
--------------------
And she's
gonna follow me
anyway.
--------------------
May as well go
along and try to
figure this out.
--------------------
All right, you win.
Lead the way.
--------------------
Good. Now,
for the last time...
--------------------
Tell me
your name.
--------------------
......
--------------------
Neku.
Neku Sakuraba.
--------------------
Neku, huh?
--------------------
Cute name.
--------------------
Shut up.
--------------------
All right, Neku.
Let's get over
to 104!
--------------------
I told you!
We can't leave!
--------------------
Oh, please.
--------------------
Durff!
--------------------
You gotta be
kidding me!
--------------------
Next time,
try listening.
--------------------
So this is all
part of that
"Reapers' Game"?
--------------------
That's
right.
--------------------
This is
nuts.
--------------------
She's actually
telling the truth?
--------------------
Then that means
the mail I got<->
--------------------
Neku! Move!
We have to get
to Ten-Four!
--------------------
Oww!
--------------------
It's blocked!
There's no
way past!
--------------------
We can't
get through!?
--------------------
But this is
the way to
Ten-Four!
--------------------
Why do I feel
like I'm being
watched?
--------------------
That guy over
there. What's he
staring at?
--------------------
......
--------------------
Pact
confirmed.
--------------------
What are we
gonna do about
this wall?
--------------------
Huh? Neku!
It's open.
--------------------
What's up
with that?
--------------------
No idea.
A lucky break,
I guess!
--------------------
C'mon, we gotta
keep moving.
--------------------
Something about
that guy in red...
--------------------
Huh?
Where'd he go?
--------------------
Weird.
--------------------
Made it!
--------------------
The timer
vanished!
--------------------
Whew!
Mission complete.
--------------------
Pfft, big deal.
--------------------
What!?
--------------------
Only an idiot
would screw up
on Day 1.
--------------------
Who's there!?
--------------------
Oh, no...
A Reaper?
--------------------
Reaper...
--------------------
You two are
gonna get erased
sooner or later.
--------------------
So come on.
Help a girl out and
earn me a few
extra points, 'K?
--------------------
Those monsters
again...
--------------------
Neku, you know
how to fight now,
right?
--------------------
This time focus
your thoughts on
me!
--------------------
What?
--------------------
Fight your
own battles!
--------------------
Please!
To stop the
Noise!
--------------------
...Fine.
--------------------
Come on!
--------------------
Good!
Now we can
fight together!
--------------------
We can beat
the Noise faster
as a team!
--------------------
Let's do this!
--------------------
Is it over?
--------------------
Not yet, Neku!
Over there!
--------------------
Whew...
This one looks
tough.
--------------------
...Like I've
got a choice.
--------------------
Hey!
Stalker!
--------------------
I'm not a
stalker!
--------------------
Whatever.
Just...
--------------------
Don't mess
this up!
--------------------
I...I won't!
--------------------
Whew...
We did it...
--------------------
But you
heard her...
Day 1 is nothing.
--------------------
What if the
missions only
get harder?
--------------------
We've got
six more days...
--------------------
Are we gonna
make it?
--------------------
I...I don't
want to be
erased...
--------------------
I can't believe
this...
--------------------
Why am I
stuck here?
--------------------
What if I'm
erased!?
--------------------
What the
hell kind of
game is this?
--------------------
This can't
be right.
--------------------
Gaaah!
--------------------
I'm really
stuck here?
In Shibuya!?
--------------------
